ABSTRACT
This study was carried out to assess the knowledge and use of rice agrochemicals, as well as the knowledge and use of safety devices and methods associated with the proper application of these chemicals. The study was conducted among rice farmers in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area (LGA) of Ogun State, Nigeria. A multi-stage random sampling technique was used to select the respondents for this study. The list of rice farmers in the study area who were registered with the Agricultural Development Zonal office was obtained, and the active farmers were identified through a preliminary field tour. One hundred and twenty-seven active farmers were randomly selected, and data were collected through a validated, structured interview schedule. About two-thirds of the farmers were aged 50 or younger, 87% were married, and 66% were literate. Approximately 86% were full-time small-scale rice farmers (69% cultivating less than 2.6 hectares), and only 48.8% of these had fortnightly contact with agricultural extension agents. Most of the farmers (72.4%) were land secure, and about half relied solely on hired labor. The knowledge level of agrochemicals and their usage were found to be moderately high. About 41% of them depended on extension agents as the primary source of information about rice agrochemicals. Other major sources included agrochemical salesmen, rice merchants, and radio and television. However, the knowledge level and actual use of safety devices and methods were low. Age (χ² = 0.266, p = 0.018) and educational level (χ² = 72.003, p = 0.051) were found to be significantly related to the knowledge of safety devices and methods used in the application of rice agrochemicals. The literacy level of farmers needs to be improved, while extension agents should intensify their visits and campaigns regarding the use of rice agrochemicals, particularly the safety devices and methods associated with their application.

INTRODUCTION
Rice is one of the oldest foods known to man, and it forms part of the three daily meals in many parts of the world. About three decades ago, except in areas where rice was grown as a traditional crop, many households consumed rice only on Sundays or during important festivities. Today, rice has become a regular part of the daily menu in many households, including those in Nigeria.
Since the early development of agricultural practices, people have sought various ways to increase crop yields. Notable methods include the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and improved cultivars. Early pesticides included substances such as urine, lime-soap suds, vinegar, tobacco, and similar compounds.
Agrochemicals are widely used in modern farming, and it is almost impossible to avoid daily exposure to low levels of different chemicals. There is growing concern about the possible adverse effects on human health from continuous long-term exposure. According to Sarnar, agricultural workers are at least twice as likely to die on the job compared to workers in other sectors. A global overview from the International Labor Organization (ILO) reported that tens of thousands of agricultural workers die each year, and millions suffer injuries or poisoning from agrochemicals. Exposure to agrochemicals also constitutes a significant risk, accounting for as much as 14% of all occupational injuries and 10% of fatalities in some agricultural sectors.
Rice farmers are exposed to agrochemicals during rice cultivation when applying insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. After harvesting, cereals are often treated with chemicals during storage to protect them from pests and diseases. It has been estimated that cereal crops receive approximately 5-8 pesticide applications per growing season.
The general public is increasingly aware of agrochemical use, as the effects of such use are not always confined to the treated area. Nitrates and fertilizers can seep into drinking water sources, and pesticides can contaminate river water or drift onto public land. Unfortunately, the public is often more aware of the benefits of agrochemical application than of the potential harms caused by misuse. A critical question is whether rice farmers are adequately educated and trained on the risks associated with agrochemical use and the safety devices required for proper handling.
To minimize the hazards caused by improper use or poor handling of agrochemicals, Udoh advocates that banned chemicals not be imported, recommended chemicals be available year-round at affordable prices, and consistent educational campaigns be conducted for rice farmers. The problem of improper handling and misuse of agrochemicals is still common among rice farmers, leading to frequent chemical accidents. Much of the responsibility for educational campaigns lies with agricultural extension agents. This study was designed to investigate the use of safety devices in the application of agrochemicals by rice farmers in Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area, Ogun State.
The specific objectives of the study are to:

Identify the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents,

Identify the commonly used agrochemicals in rice production in the study area,

Assess the respondents' knowledge of safety devices used in agrochemical application,

Determine the extent to which safety devices are used by the respondents.

The hypotheses of the study are:

There is no significant relationship between selected personal characteristics (age, cosmopolitanism, level of education, primary occupation, farm size, labor, extension contact) and the adoption of rice agrochemicals.

There is no significant relationship between selected personal characteristics (age, cosmopolitanism, level of education, primary occupation, farm size, labor, extension contact) and the knowledge of safety measures used in the application of rice agrochemicals.

METHODOLOGY
This study was conducted among rice farmers in Obafemi-Owode LGA, Ogun State, Nigeria. The list of registered rice farmers from the Agricultural Development Programme Zonal office in Ikenne indicated that 426 farmers were still active. These farmers were registered in 'cells,' which are geographical units for easier administration by village extension agents (VEAs). One hundred and thirty farmers were randomly selected, representing one-third of the registered farmers, proportionate to the number of cells. These 130 farmers constituted the sample for the study, and a validated, structured interview schedule was administered to collect data. One hundred and twenty-seven interview schedules were found to be properly administered and were processed for analysis. The data were subjected to both descriptive and inferential analyses.

RESULTS
Sex: Data collected showed that 93.7% of the respondents were male, while 6.3% were female.
Age, Marital status, Level of education: Table 1a indicates that almost two-thirds (63.4%) of the respondents were aged 50 years or younger, while 12.2% were above 60 years. About 87% were married, and only 5% were single. Approximately 66% of the farmers were literate, with the majority (38.6%) having attended only primary school, while 4% had post-secondary education.
Primary and Secondary occupations: The data revealed that 86% of the respondents engaged in farming as their primary occupation, while 21.3% adopted farming as a secondary occupation. Most of the farmers with secondary occupations were involved in non-farm income-generating activities, such as trading (15%), artisan work (14.2%), and civil service (11.2%). Only 21.3% had no secondary occupation.
Membership of formal social groups: Most respondents (63%) were members of cooperative societies, while 37% did not belong to any formal organization (Table 1b). About 41% were members of religious groups, 21.3% were members of socio-cultural groups, and 17% were involved in trade/professional associations.
Cosmopolitanism: This refers to exposure to more developed areas outside the respondents' localities. It is measured by the frequency of visits to major towns or cities. About 45% of respondents had a high level of cosmopolitanism (26% visited weekly, 18.9% fortnightly), while 35.4% rarely traveled beyond their farming communities.
Extension contact: Table 1b indicates that only 48.8% of respondents had fortnightly contact with extension services, while 27.6% had no contact with extension agents.
Farm size, Land ownership, Labour source: Data showed that most farmers (68.5%) were small-scale producers, cultivating less than 2.6 hectares of land. About 72.4% of farmers had secure land tenure, with 66.9% operating on inherited land and 5.5% purchasing their land. Only 17.3% of respondents depended solely on family labor, while 49.6% relied solely on hired labor, and 25% supplemented hired labor with family labor.

Knowledge and Use of Agrochemicals:
Table 2 shows the knowledge and use of various rice agrochemicals. Approximately 54% of farmers were knowledgeable about herbicides, but only 41.4% used them. For seed dressing chemicals, 51.2% had knowledge, but only 30% used them. About 78.7% were aware of pesticides, but only 50.4% used them.
Main Source of Knowledge about Agrochemicals:
Table 3 reveals that the majority (40.9%) of farmers relied on agricultural extension agents for information on agrochemicals, while 10% depended on salesmen of agrochemicals. Rice merchants provided information to 16.5% of farmers, and 24.4% used radio and television as their main source of information.

Knowledge and Use of Safety Devices:
Data from Tables 4 and 5 show the percentage of farmers who knew about and used safety devices during agrochemical application. Forty percent of farmers knew that overalls should be worn when applying herbicides, but only 11.8% actually used them. Twelve percent of farmers knew they should bathe after applying pesticides, but only 6.3% followed this advice. Other important safety practices, such as wearing face masks and gloves, were not commonly adopted.
The study found that about 28.5% of respondents knew about safety practices but did not adopt them, and 68% had no knowledge of any safety methods.
Testing the Hypothesis
The data revealed that there was a significant relationship between age and the use of safety devices (χ² = 0.266, p = 0.018). Similarly, there was a significant relationship between educational level and the adoption of safety methods (χ² = 72.003, p = 0.051).

DISCUSSION
The results of the study revealed that most rice farmers in Obafemi-Owode LGA of Ogun State had moderate knowledge of agrochemicals and their use but had limited awareness and adoption of safety devices and practices. This finding is consistent with the work of Udoh, who also reported low levels of safety awareness among Nigerian farmers. The low adoption of safety devices could be attributed to the lack of adequate training and the high cost of safety equipment.
The study also found a significant relationship between age, educational level, and the use of safety devices, which suggests that younger and more educated farmers are more likely to adopt safety measures. This highlights the need for targeted extension programs that focus on the benefits of safety practices and provide practical solutions for their implementation.
CONCLUSION
The study concluded that while rice farmers in Obafemi-Owode LGA possess some knowledge about agrochemicals, their awareness and use of safety devices were low. Efforts to improve farmers' knowledge and adoption of safety practices should include targeted extension services, public awareness campaigns, and increased accessibility to safety devices.
