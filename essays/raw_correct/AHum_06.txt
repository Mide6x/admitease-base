Grammatical Tones
Grammatical tones are tones that have grammatical significance and, within the autosegmental framework of generative phonology, they exist independently of 'segmental' phonological strings. They are assigned to specific positions in grammatical constructions where they play a role in the tonal output of the strings in their surface form. Tone plays a significant role in the grammar of Urhobo as most of the grammatical information is conveyed through the manipulation of tones. For example, tense and aspectual information are often indicated by tones. The segmentation of these grammatical tones usually leads to modifications in the lexical tones carried by neighboring segments.

Tone in the Associative Noun Phrase
The associative construction, also known as the Noun + Noun phrase, is marked by the morpheme /re/ which carries a high tone and is positioned between the two nouns. In normal speech, the vowel of this associative marker is consistently omitted, but its high tone persists and is transferred onto the prefix vowel of the following noun, resulting in tonal changes on the second noun.

From the examples provided, it is evident that while the first nouns in each phrase maintain their lexical tones, the prefix vowels of the second nouns all adopt the high tone imparted by the associative marker. Consequently, in examples 6(a), (b), and (d), where the second nouns originally start with a low tone in their citation form, they become high due to the high tone of the associative marker transferring onto their prefix vowel. Thus, a tonal shift from low to high occurs. In example 6(c), where the second noun already carries a high tone, no tonal modification occurs as the two high tones simply merge into one.

Tone in the Verb Phrase
Most simple verbs in Urhobo are either monosyllabic or disyllabic and typically start with a consonant segment. In the verb class, there are no minimal pairs where the only difference in meaning arises from tone patterns. While nouns can be classified based on their tone patterns, verbs cannot. In the citation form, all verbs and monosyllabic subject and object pronouns are realized with a low tone. Although various tonal variations exist in verbs, these are usually influenced by the grammatical contexts in which they are used. Consequently, verbs with similar syllable structures behave similarly within the same grammatical context. For instance, all monosyllabic verbs exhibit similar tonal behavior in a past tense construction, just as all disyllabic verbs do. Urhobo verbs, along with monosyllabic subject and object pronouns, are assumed to be inherently toneless and acquire tone based on their grammatical context. Therefore, tone carries significant syntactic weight, particularly in the verb phrase. To analyze tonal variations in the Urhobo verb phrase, it is essential to acknowledge the presence of tonal morphemes (tomorphs) or grammatical tones as integral components of the grammar. These tomorphs can be single-tone units or fixed tonal patterns that hold grammatical significance independently of segmental strings. They are distinct from lexical tones and are segmented in specific positions within the grammatical structure, often leading to the dissociation or gliding of lexical tones.

In this section, we will explore grammatical constructions in the three fundamental tenses: present, past, and future.

The Present Tense
The present tense in Urhobo serves to convey habitual, present, or continuous actions. The tense is marked by a floating high tone that appears at the end of the subject noun phrase. To manifest this tomorph, the final vowel of the subject noun phrase is slightly prolonged. If the subject noun phrase already ends with a high tone, both the high tone and the final vowel are perceptibly lengthened. However, if the subject noun phrase ends with a low tone, the present tense tomorph is segmented onto the elongated part of the final vowel. As mentioned earlier, when the subject pronoun or verb lacks a tomorph, it is articulated with a low tone. Consequently, in the case of a pronoun as the subject noun phrase, the initial part of the vowel carries a low tone while the elongated portion bears the high tone. Let us examine some examples. (Note: pr.t= present tomorph.)

The Past Tense
In the full form of the past tense, the verb is supplemented with a suffix that appears in two phonological forms depending on the vowel harmony requirements of the verb stem vowel. The vowels in Urhobo fall into two groups based on vowel harmony, with the Advanced Tongue Root [ATR] being the harmony feature. Vowels such as /i, e, o, u/ are [+ATR], whereas /แบน, a, o/ are [-ATR]. The two forms of the verb suffix are -ri and -re. If the verb stem vowel is [+ATR], it takes the suffix -ri; if the verb stem is [-ATR], it takes -re. This suffix is only present when the verb is not followed by an object; if an object follows, the suffix is omitted.

Regarding tonal changes, the past tense construction introduces a high tomorph, which is segmented onto the sole vowel segment of a monosyllabic verb stem or the final vowel of a disyllabic verb stem. When a verb stem is accompanied by a noun object, the final vowel of the verb stem is either omitted or forms a glide, leading to the past tense tomorph being detached. As a grammatical tone, it must reconnect with the prefix vowel of the subsequent noun object, causing the dissociation of the lexical tone in that position if it is low. However, if the tone is high, it merges with the high tomorph, rendering the reconnection effect void. Let us consider some examples:

The Future Tense
The complete form of the future tense is marked segmentally by a particle positioned between the subject noun phrase and the verb stem of the clause. This particle manifests in two phonological forms, /che/ and /cha/, depending on the vowel harmony requirement of the verb stem vowel. If the verb stem vowel is [-(-ART], it selects /che/; if it is [-ART], it selects /cha/. The future tense signifies an action that is yet to commence or one that is being contemplated.

Tonally, the future tense construction features a H - L - H tone sequence distributed as follows:
a) the initial high tone is segmented onto the final vowel of the subject noun phrase (or the sole vowel segment of a monosyllabic subject pronoun).
b) the low tone is assigned to the future tense particle.
c) the second high tone is allocated to the first vowel of the verb stem and extends to any subsequent vowel segments within the verb stem, resulting in all verb stem vowels being articulated as high. Let us consider some examples:

The examples above illustrate that tonal variations in this construction are a consequence of segmentalizing the two high tones marking the future tense. The segmentation of the first high tone onto the subject noun phrase causes the inherent or lexical tone in that position to detach automatically if it is low. (This differs from the present tomorph, where segmentalization leads to the elongation of the final vowel of the subject noun phrase to accommodate the tomorph.) The second high tone of the future tense spreads to other vowel segments within the verb stem if the verb stem is not monosyllabic. Unlike the past tense tomorph, the future tense tomorph does spread. However, similar to the past tense tomorph, if the final vowel of the verb stem is omitted or becomes a glide, the tomorph must reattach, resulting in the automatic dissociation of a subsequent inherent tone. In each scenario, if the inherent tone is also high, the impact of segmentalization is inconsequential.

Negation and Interrogation
Negation in Urhobo is indicated by a floating L H tone sequence that is applied to the final vowel during phonetic realization. To accommodate this tone sequence, the final vowel is elongated, represented orthographically by doubling the final vowel. Conversely, interrogation is marked by a floating low tone on the final vowel of the statement. If the statement concludes with a low tone, adding the question morpheme creates an additional low level in the utterance. However, if the statement ends with a high tone, attaching the question morpheme generates a HL contour without lengthening the final vowel. Here are some examples:

From the above discussion, it is evident that tone serves both lexical and grammatical functions in Urhobo and is as crucial, if not more so, than the consonant and vowel segments used in speech.

The Importance of Tone Marking in the Writing System
We have provided a technical treatment in section 3 to demonstrate that tone in Urhobo is a systematic phenomenon deeply embedded in the language's grammar, rather than a random or discretionary element. Tone can differentiate word meanings and distinguish various grammatical structures.

Some individuals oppose the use of tone marks in writing due to its absence in English, considering it untidy. It is important to remember that English is not a tonal language like Urhobo. In English, saying 'clear' with a high, mid, or low tone conveys the same meaning, whereas in Urhobo, a change in tone can alter word meanings. Failure to mark tone in writing would lead to ambiguity in many sentences, resulting in loss of time and meaning.
