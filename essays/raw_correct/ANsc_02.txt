Abstract
The aim of this study was to review the epidemiology and morbidity of Oro-Facial cancers managed at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH). The objectives were to estimate the incidence and prevalence of Oro-facial cancer cases, highlight the poor prognosis despite better management facilities, and evaluate the factors influencing this poor prognosis.

Patients and Method
A five-year retrospective study was conducted on 211 patients with Oro-facial cancers treated at the maxillofacial unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Kaduna. Data from the patients' medical records, including demographic patterns, clinical features, histopathological findings, and treatment modalities, were analyzed.

Results
Of the 211 Oro-facial cancer cases, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounted for 136 (64%) cases, adenocystic carcinoma for 30 (14%), adenocarcinoma for 11 (5%), metastatic carcinoma for 8 (4%), and other types for 26 (13%). Housewives, farmers, and traders made up 152 (71%) of the patients. A staggering 92% (192 patients) presented at an advanced stage of the disease, making little to no intervention possible. The age of presentation ranged from 15 to 84 years, with a median age of 44.5 years. Males were more frequently affected, with 135 (64%) cases compared to 76 (36%) females, resulting in a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1.

Conclusion
Public awareness campaigns are crucial to encourage early detection, as the majority of individuals in this environment have access to radio media.

Introduction
Despite recent advances in cancer management, Oro-facial carcinoma remains a major health concern globally, particularly in our environment. The primary factor contributing to the poor prognosis in Kaduna and surrounding areas is late presentation. For the past four decades, the maxillofacial unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital has been the leading surgical center in Northern Nigeria for managing Oro-facial cancers, serving an estimated population of 60 million people (Census 2006).

Material and Method
Between January 2000 and December 2004, 400 patients were managed for Oro-facial malignancies at the maxillofacial unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Kaduna. The records of 211 patients were traced and retrospectively reviewed. Collected data included age, sex, geographical location, occupation, tumor site, duration of the tumor, histological type, aetiological factors, treatment modalities, prognosis, and follow-up.

Results
The patients' ages ranged from 15 to 84 years, with a mean age of 44.5 years and a standard deviation of 41.72. Most patients (135, 64%) were aged between 40 and 49 years. There were 76 (36%) females, resulting in a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. Although the center is located in the North-Central Zone (Middle Belt) of Nigeria, patients come from all regions, with a significant majority (144, 68.25%) being native to Northern Nigeria. Ethnically, 136 (64.45%) were Hausas, the dominant tribal group in Northern Nigeria. Housewives and farmers were notably affected.

Regarding tumor histology, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common type, accounting for 63.51% of cases, typically affecting the palate. Adenocystic carcinoma, which also commonly affects the palate, was the second most frequent. Tumors commonly affected the mandible, palate, maxillary antrum, and maxilla. The majority of patients (90%) presented with advanced-stage tumors. Many had sought treatment from traditional practitioners and were unaware of available orthodox treatments, with financial limitations also contributing to delayed presentation. Swelling was the most common symptom (60%), while tooth mobility, abscess formation, and pus discharge were rarely observed. Interestingly, pain was not a common feature of presentation, even in cases where the tumor appeared grotesque.

Discussion
Oro-facial cancer is a serious and often fatal disease if untreated. It can affect any tissue in the oro-facial region, with the oral cavity being a common site. Typically, it begins as a rough patch, ulcer, or lump affecting the lip, tongue, or floor of the mouth and is prone to metastasizing to the cervical lymph nodes. The prognosis is often poor, especially with late presentation. Globally, there has been a concerning rise in the incidence of oral cancer, especially among young males in recent decades. Despite advancements in management strategies, the five-year survival rate remains about 55%.

Factors contributing to the poor prognosis include late presentation, lack of awareness, poverty, local beliefs (e.g., the misconception that "cancer does not like injections"), and long distances from treatment centers. Additionally, the high cost of management and a shortage of medical professionals to effectively handle cases further exacerbate the poor prognosis in Africa. Tobacco and alcohol abuse are major aetiological factors worldwide, with a synergistic effect leading to an increase in new cases, especially among young adults.

In this study, 211 cases of Oro-facial carcinoma were analyzed. The annual occurrence of the disease was approximately 30 cases, showing a slight increase from 25 cases reported in a previous study at this center in 1985. Males were more affected than females, with 135 (63%) male cases compared to 76 (36%) female cases, yielding a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. This is slightly lower than the previous ratio of 2:1 at the same center but higher than the 1.5:1 ratio reported in Ibadan and Lagos. The male predominance is linked to the high prevalence of tobacco and alcohol abuse among males.

The age range was wide, from 15 to 84 years, with a peak occurrence between the 4th and 5th decades of life. This represents a shift from previous studies where the peak age was in the 5th and 6th decades. The mean age in this study was lower compared to studies from America (62 years), Canada (60 years), India (57 years), Britain (63 years), and Australia (60 years), but higher than reports from Lagos (49 years), Ibadan (48 years), and previous studies at the department (45 years).

The tumor distribution in this study showed a different pattern from previous studies. The maxillary antrum was the most frequent site of occurrence (37 cases), followed by the mandible (36 cases), palate (35 cases), and maxilla (30 cases). This suggests that more than 60% of all carcinomas were located in the middle third of the face, particularly the maxillary antrum and related surfaces. Previous studies had focused more on intra-oral rather than oro-facial cancers. Late presentation made it difficult to determine the precise location of some tumors, as some cases involving the palate and maxilla might have been advanced-stage tumors of the maxillary antrum or vice versa. The tumors appeared to favor the left side of the face, with more cases on the left than the right for the maxilla, maxillary antrum, mandible, and other areas.
