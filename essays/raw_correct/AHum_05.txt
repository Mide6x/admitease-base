Explaining Culture and Religion

Culture
The concept of culture, as defined by E. Tylor, is the "complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society." The simplest definition is provided by Robert Bierstedt, who states, "Culture is the complex whole that consists of all the ways we think and do everything we have as members of society." In all definitions of culture, there are components that are readily identifiable. First, culture is shared. In other words, culture makes sense only in reference to groups of people. It is a common satisfier of people's needs and demands.

The second component is that no society can exist without a culture. All known human societies, whether urban or rural, simple or complex, have cultures distinct to them. Culture provides the basic common understanding and sense of belonging without which societies cannot exist. The rules guiding behavior and social order are provided by shared culture.

A direct implication of this is that culture is learned. Learning can only occur when two or more persons interact. Through learning, cultural transmission is facilitated, thus ensuring the transmission and preservation of culture from one generation to another. It is through these processes that culture is preserved, allowing us to talk about religious beliefs, practices, customs, folkways, traditions, mores, and norms. Teaching and learning the ways of a culture may be conscious, as in direct tuition, or unconscious, as in imitation. This process is what is commonly referred to as socialization—the learning and internalization of behaviors that are not biologically determined.

The third component, which is quite important, is that culture is dynamic. It changes over time; most of the cultural practices we witness today have evolved over the years. Many have been affected by modernization and industrialization. The African belief system, for example, seems to have been particularly impacted by these changes.

Religion
The concept and idea of religion mean different things to different people. Philosophers from Plato in ancient Greece to the present day have advanced various arguments to prove the existence of God. While some believe that God does not exist, others, like the German philosopher Nietzsche, argue that God once existed but is now dead. To psychologists, religion is a continuation of a child's conception and attitude towards their father into adulthood. According to Sigmund Freud, because of man's realization of his weakness and helplessness when faced with life's challenges—death, disease, poverty, disaster, and trauma—he seeks protection. This search for protection is fulfilled by creating an imaginary being/father in God. This behavior, according to psychologists, is a projection of the child's image of his father, which is extended into the realms of the supernatural. Hence, most religions, if not all, turn to God (as a child does to his father) in times of need and difficulty.

To sociologists, religion is a creation of society. According to Durkheim, it is society that creates and uses religion as an instrument to control, mold, and direct thinking and behavior. Durkheim’s theory of religion sees God as a personification of the pervasive forces of society, with the laws and commandments of God representing the demands society makes on its members for its own self-preservation.

To Marxists, religion is simply the "opium of the masses." The Marxists adopted the economic theory of exploitation to explain religion. According to them, religion is man's self-alienation. They are more concerned with understanding why people turn to religion, thereby alienating themselves. The Marxists’ simple explanation is that the exploitation of the masses by the rich encourages religion, which helps keep the masses under control and prevents rebellion. Thus, the word "opium" is used as a metaphor for the "sedative" provided to the masses. To theologians, religion is man's search for his source; this search for the infinite spirit, which is man's origin, constitutes religion. The etymology of the word 'religion' comes from three Latin words: ligare (to bind), relegere (to unite or link), and religion (relationship). The term essentially means a bond established between human beings and the divine. This relationship unites humans with a transcendental being—a deity that humans believe to exist and worship.

The interesting aspect of religion is its influence and grip on human life. The influence of religion cannot be ignored in explaining or interpreting human behavior. Its grip on human behavior has significantly contributed to the use of God’s name in shaping and controlling people, often leading to manipulation. History is filled with examples of religion’s influence on human activities. All discussions about miracles, faith in God, and belief systems are part of human encounters with religion and their understanding of God.

Religion plays an important role in the lives of believers. It has a revitalizing and cohesive component, which helps people find meaning and purpose in life while encouraging them to live morally by providing incentives (such as the promise of eternity) to do so. All known religions in the world espouse peace and love for all of God’s creatures. Many people who are frustrated find meaning and consolation in religion. Without it, many would likely resort to suicide. Omorogbe noted that there would have been many more suicides if religion did not provide solace, meaning, and courage to those who have lost hope and feel that their lives are meaningless and "not worth living."

The Link Between Culture and Religion
Culture and religion are closely interwoven. All known religions of the world have their origins, beliefs, and practices rooted in the cultures from which they grew. Their doctrines often reflect the worldview of their respective cultures. It is nearly impossible to understand any religion without understanding the culture in which it developed. This explains why many early European writers and missionaries misunderstood African traditional religion—they lacked knowledge of the African culture in which it evolved.

All known religions—Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Islam, Christianity, etc.—grew from the cultural contexts of their times. Their practices and belief systems are rooted in their respective cultures. For instance, it is nearly impossible to understand Christianity without understanding the Jewish-Greco-Roman culture. Similarly, Islam cannot be understood without knowledge of Arabic culture, and Hinduism, Buddhism, or Jainism cannot be understood without understanding Indian culture. Taoist or Confucian religions cannot be understood without knowledge of Chinese culture, and Shintoism cannot be fully appreciated without understanding Japanese culture.

All religions are products of particular cultures. Since no culture can be considered the only approved culture by God for the whole world, no one culture or religion can be considered superior to another. Neither can anyone impose their cultural values, as expressed in their religion, on the entire world. The dynamism of culture introduces change, and such changes are often met with resistance. Change is a constant phenomenon in human life, yet it is frequently resisted. Resistance to the dynamism of culture often gives rise to extremism within religious groups. Some adherents believe that there is no room for change in cultural practices, and any deviation from the original practice is resisted, sometimes violently. Religious extremists may oppose government policies and insist on an alternative that they consider stricter (as seen with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and certain Islamic extremists in Saudi Arabia).

The Saudi state was initially formed in alliance with the Wahhabi religious movement, and its laws were established to ensure compliance with the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam. Since much of the Saudi government’s legitimacy is based on the country’s role in Islam, Saudi Arabia—the birthplace of Muhammad and the protector of Islam—is known for practicing the strictest interpretation of Islamic law. Today, the Saudi governing elite faces opposition from religious extremists within the country, with support from fundamentalists outside. These critics accuse the ruling class of not being sufficiently religious and of being too closely allied with the anti-Islamic West.

Culture, Religion, and Terrorism: Any Connection?
The question here is whether terrorism can be associated with any particular culture or religion. In other words, can the cycle of violence and counter-violence—the misery and destruction inflicted on human society daily—be explained by any cultural or religious tenets? Furthermore, is violence an approved conflict-resolution method in any culture or faith? Or is violence an instrument of conversion in any religion? Does violence in any form lead to the increase of followers or adherents? Is jihad synonymous with armed rebellion against the existing social order? Can any religion’s influence expand in an atmosphere of insecurity and wanton destruction of lives and property? Or do people simply decide to use God’s name to pursue hidden agendas?

To address these fundamental questions, we will examine the basic doctrines of two major world religions: Islam and Christianity. We focus on these two religions because both originated in the Middle East but are rooted in distinct cultures—the Arabic and Western cultures. Moreover, many of the world’s known terrorist zones in recent times—such as the Middle East, Chechnya, Kosovo, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Algeria—are in regions dominated by either Muslim or Christian cultures. It is also worth noting that there are other global crisis areas, such as the Zapatista guerrilla movement in Mexico, the drug cartel in Colombia, and the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia, where religious culture does not serve as a tool for propaganda.

To establish a solid foundation for our conclusions, religious scholars from both Muslim and Christian backgrounds were interviewed. Focused interviews with Muslim scholars and Imams were conducted to determine if Muslims are generally pro-violence or pro-terrorism, since terms like extremists, fanatics, fundamentalists, separatists, and Islamic militants are frequently used to describe terrorists. The consensus among the interviewed scholars is that Islam, as a religion, abhors violence. The very concept of Islam is peace, and the faith is founded on the principles of peace, tolerance, and brotherhood. According to one Muslim cleric, Allah condemns the use of violence in any form. Citing the Quran, he stated, "Violence cannot be used to achieve anything for Allah, no matter how important the cause may be." He referred to another Quranic verse to support this view, which reads:
...If your Lord had willed, surely all those on earth would have believed without exception... will you then force people to become believers?
