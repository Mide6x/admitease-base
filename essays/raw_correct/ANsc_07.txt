**ABSTRACT**

Concentrations of the trace metals lead, iron, copper, and zinc were estimated in crops harvested from oil prospecting locations in Rivers State, Nigeria. The locations were Agbada-Aluu (AA), Ebocha (EB), Idu Ekpeye (IE), Obagi (OB), and Trans Amadi Layout (TA), with the Teaching and Research Farm of Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt, serving as the control. The crops investigated were cassava (Manihot esculenta), cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta), okra (Hibiscus esculentus), pumpkin leaves (Telfairia occidentalis), and waterleaf (Talinum triangulare). Results of the mean lead concentrations ranged from 1.1 µg/g in cocoyam to 9.1 µg/g in okra, showing higher trends in industrialized areas. While cocoyam had the lowest lead concentration, other crops did not differ significantly from one another. Crops from locations TA, OB, IE, and EB had significantly higher concentrations of lead, although IE, AA, and TF were not significantly different from each other. Mean concentrations of iron ranged from 40 µg/g in cassava from TF to 651 µg/g in pumpkin leaves from TA, reflecting a high level of pollution from the various industries in that location. Pumpkin leaves exhibited the highest level of iron, followed by other green vegetables such as waterleaf and okra. Copper concentrations ranged from 4.4 µg/g in cocoyam from TF to 23 µg/g in pumpkin leaves from TA. Pumpkin leaves had the highest copper concentrations, followed by okra, waterleaf, cocoyam, and cassava. Zinc concentrations in crops ranged from 29 µg/g in cocoyam from TF to 240 µg/g in pumpkin leaves from EB. Pumpkin leaves and okra contained the highest levels of zinc, followed by waterleaf, cassava, and cocoyam. In terms of location, TA, OB, and EB had the highest concentrations of metals in crops, with the least concentrations occurring in TF and AA. These results reflect higher concentrations of metals in crops from industrialized locations, with the green vegetables, particularly pumpkin leaves, having the highest uptake, while cocoyam had the least. These findings raise concerns, particularly as heavy metals are bio-accumulative in the system, posing serious health risks to humans and animals.

**INTRODUCTION**

Increased human activities such as industrialization, over-population, and elevated ambient temperatures have become significant environmental issues in recent years. Oil prospecting and other industrial activities lead to pollution through gas flares, oil spills, and industrial effluent, which negatively affect both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, contributing to the destruction of forests and farmlands. Rivers State, located in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, is rich in oil resources, which has led to a rise in industrial activities. Refining and petroleum companies account for about 70-75 percent of the industrial activities in the region. These activities generate a wide variety of air and water pollutants and hazardous solid wastes. Pollutants such as lead, mercury, nickel, arsenic, zinc, and copper are frequently emitted and can contaminate air, soil, and water, endangering the health of nearby communities.

Exposure to even low levels of metals like lead, cadmium, and mercury can have cumulative effects, as there are no regulatory mechanisms to control their levels in the human body. Lead intoxication has been linked to neurological problems, renal dysfunction, and anemia. While zinc and copper are essential trace elements, their presence in the environment due to industrial discharge can also pose health risks. Heavy metal absorption by plants is influenced by soil characteristics like pH and organic matter content, and the extent of accumulation varies with the plant species and metal type.

Studies on metal concentrations near oil refineries in Nigeria have shown elevated levels of various heavy metals in the soil. The petroleum industry is the largest industrial sector in the Niger Delta, but other industries such as steel, glass, and paint manufacturing also contribute to environmental pollution. The increasing industrialization, particularly from oil exploration and exploitation, has heightened awareness of the pollution of the environment and the potential dangers to human health. Although there is substantial data on heavy metal concentrations in water, aquatic life, and mangrove swamps, there is limited information on heavy metal concentrations in food crops in the Niger Delta region. This study aims to fill that gap by investigating the concentrations of lead, iron, copper, and zinc in food crops harvested from oil prospecting and industrial areas of Rivers State.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**Study Location:**  
The study locations included Agbada-Aluu (AA), Ebocha (EB), Idu Ekpeye (IE), Obagi (OB), Trans-Amadi Industrial Layout (TA), and Rivers State University of Science and Technology Teaching/Research Farm (TF). The University farm, located away from industrial or oil-prospecting areas, served as the control. Ebocha, Idu Ekpeye, and Obagi are oil prospecting areas, while Agbada-Aluu is an abandoned gas flaring site, and Trans-Amadi is the industrial hub of Rivers State.

**Collection of Samples:**  
The crops studied were common staples and vegetables: cassava (Manihot esculenta), cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta), pumpkin leaves (Telfairia occidentalis), waterleaf (Talinum triangulare), and okra (Hibiscus esculentus). These crops were harvested during the peak harvest period (May to July) from farms in oil prospecting or industrial areas. Crops were harvested randomly from two or three farms per location and transported to the laboratory for drying and analysis.

**Preparation of Samples:**  
Crops were washed in de-ionized water, drained, shredded, or diced depending on the type (root or vegetable), and dried at 60°C for about 72 hours. The dried samples were then milled and sieved for analysis.

**Determination of Metals:**  
The samples were digested using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and perchloric acid (HCLO4), followed by filtration and dilution. The digested samples were analyzed for trace metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS), with calibration using standard solutions of lead, iron, copper, and zinc.

**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:**  
Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significant difference (LSD) at a 5% significance level to determine mean differences.

**RESULTS**

**Lead:**  
The results indicated that lead concentrations in crops ranged from 1.1 µg/g in cocoyam from TF to 9.1 µg/g in okra from TA. Crops from TA, OB, IE, and EB had significantly higher lead concentrations compared to those from TF and AA. The concentration of lead was notably higher in industrialized areas, indicating pollution from industrial activities.
