Chemical Qualities of Oils from Some Fresh and Market Vegetable Crops within Kwara State, Nigeria

Abstract
The potential for Nigeria to lead Africa and the world in biofuel and oleochemical production was examined by evaluating the oil yield and chemical qualities of oil extracted from fresh and market samples of naturally abundant vegetables (Mangifera indica, Prunus dulcis Miller, Ricinnus communis, and Elaeis guineensis) in Nigeria. The study determined the moisture, ash, and crude fat composition, as well as the free fatty acid, acid, and saponification values of the oils. Almond was observed to have a high mineral composition compared to other vegetables. The study reported moisture content ranging from 5.006% to 63.650%, crude fat from 12.511% to 67.807%, and ash levels from 1.305% to 4.605% across different seeds. The findings suggested potential assets for biofuel and oleochemical production in Nigeria, particularly oils from almond seed, castor seed, palm oil, and groundnut oil.

Introduction
Nigeria possesses a variety of oil seeds such as groundnut, oil palm, soybean, and cotton seeds. The economic significance of oil crops necessitates thorough investigation to determine their oil quality parameters, crucial for marketing and processing seed oil. Vegetable oils are primarily used in food products, manufacturing of soap, detergents, paints, varnishes, and various industrial applications. Oil is predominantly found in plant seeds and, occasionally, in the fleshy part of fruits. Vegetable oil-derived fuel is a relatively novel concept globally, with biodiesel serving as a versatile fuel produced from various fats or vegetable oils. There has been significant progress in utilizing vegetable oils and their derivatives in biolubricants. The health benefits of vegetable oils, especially coconut oil, have been well-documented, highlighting their potential in various industries.

Conclusion
Nigeria has the potential to lead the world and maintain its leading role in Africa in oleochemical and biodiesel production from vegetable oils. This study assessed the oil qualities of potential oil crops, expanding on prior research. Notable oil seeds with potential for production include okra, baobab, sour sap, ogbono, 'Gawasa' Hausa, oilbean seed, pumpkin fruit, walnut, and African breadfruit. The findings indicate promising opportunities for commercial oil production in Nigeria, particularly oils from almond, castor seed, palm kernel, and groundnut. Further research and investment in this sector could position Nigeria as a key player in biofuel and oleochemical production.
