1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY

Language is a powerful tool through which individuals express their ideas, emotions, feelings, and thoughts. It serves as a vehicle for the transmission of culture across generations and facilitates communication within societies. To be effective members of society, individuals must acquire proficiency in their native language.

In Nigeria, the English language functions as a common medium of communication among various ethnic groups. It is considered a second language, following the mother tongue, and is utilized as the official language and medium of instruction in Nigerian schools. Despite this, the majority of Nigerian children learn English as a second language through formal classroom education.

One of the primary aims of English language instruction in Nigerian schools is to equip students with the ability to communicate effectively through speech and writing. To assess students' proficiency in English, schools conduct various types of tests covering language skills such as writing, speaking, and reading.

Akere (1995) highlights the issue of poor English language quality taught and used by students, a persistent problem as many Nigerian secondary school students struggle with English proficiency. Aliyu (1995) found a rapid decline in students' English proficiency based on West African Examination Council (WAEC) results, with failure rates ranging from 70% to 75% between 1991 and 1995. Reports from the WAEC Chief Examiner in May/June 2002 indicated over 60% of students failed in English language. This trend of mass failure persists, as noted by Oyinloye (2006). Ayodele (2001) expresses concerns about Nigerian students' low competency in English, impacting their overall academic performance.

Ubahakwe (1979) criticizes the inadequate teaching methods employed by language teachers and calls for a revolutionary approach to teaching. Ekpenyong (2002) emphasizes how English facilitates communication across diverse cultural and linguistic groups in Nigeria. Various authors have underscored the significance of English in fostering unity among heterogeneous groups in Nigeria, serving as a crucial language for governmental transactions at all levels.

English is not only essential for communication and education but also plays a pivotal role in Nigeria's global interactions in politics, trade, and broadcasting. It is the language that Nigeria employs to express its diplomacy, cultural identity, and engage in international markets.

English is a fundamental subject in the Nigerian educational system, serving as both a language of instruction and a core subject at all educational levels. Despite its importance, studies by Ekpo (1992) and Udofot (2000) reveal poor student performance in English, leading to many students from Akwa Ibom State struggling to gain admission to universities due to English language deficiencies.

The high rate of failure in English language among Nigerian secondary school students necessitates interventions to enhance their performance. Guidance and counseling have proven effective in improving productivity in various fields by addressing students' diverse backgrounds, learning abilities, and performance challenges.
