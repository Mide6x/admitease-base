Badagry Recalls the Slave Route

Today, slavery is a poignant subject in areas affected by one of history’s cruelest acts. Badagry, one of the slave ports along the West African coast, is planning a significant event. Joe Agbro Jr. reports.

For the past ten years, every August 23rd, the atrocities of slavery have been commemorated as one of the most despicable acts in human history. It has become a tradition for the people of Badagry, Lagos, to remember the turbulent and tragic times of the slave trade, which tragically displaced over 15 million Africans from their homelands.

This year's commemoration in Badagry is dedicated to the late pop legend, Michael Joseph Jackson, who passed away in July. Although slavery was officially abolished in Badagry on March 18, 1852, the scars still remain. The Gberefun point of no return, the slave market, and the slave route serve as stark reminders of this dark chapter in history.

On the night of August 22nd, 1791, through the morning of the next day on the Island of Santo Domingo, an uprising marked the beginning of the end of the transatlantic slave trade. The significance of this date is not lost on the black community, who have endured the most from the horrors of slavery. It is for this reason that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated August 23rd as the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition.

Following a series of events, the Egun people, the predominant tribe in Badagry, claim Michael Jackson as one of their own sons who was sold into slavery through the 'point-of-no-return'. When questioned about the verification of Jackson's origins in Badagry, Prince Yomi Ajose, the Senior Special Adviser on Tourism to the Chairman of Badagry Local Government, dismissed Western science and relied on African traditions.

Ajose recounted a visit to Michigan, USA, in October 1996, for an African World Expo where he met Mayor Gary Loster and was introduced to Marlon Jackson. It wasn't until last year when Marlon Jackson visited the slave route on March 7, 2008, that he expressed a deep connection to the place. Through consultations with the Ifa Oracle, it was revealed that the Jackson family indeed hailed from Badagry, specifically from an Ajaneson family of Vothun Priest lineage.

Based on Marlon's strong sense of déjà vu and the Ifa divinations, the 2009 ceremony, sponsored by various organizations, will take place. The theme for this year's celebration is 'Family Reunion', featuring picnics, symposia, speeches, dramas, a candlelight procession, Vothun Festival, African Arts exhibition, Zamgbetto Festival, Boat Regatta, and the final burial rites for Michael Jackson.

For the burial rites, Chief Zannu Awhanvoyetho, a chief priest of Vothun, stated that a portion of Jackson's earth would be brought to Badagry for interment. Other rituals will follow, with permission granted by the Jackson family.

The Motherland Group has initiated the construction of a museum to house Michael Jackson's memorabilia.
