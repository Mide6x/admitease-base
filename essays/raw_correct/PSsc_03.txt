The Shape of Real Estate in the Post-Capitalization Era

As the deadline set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for all commercial banks to capitalize to the tune of N25 billion approaches, some have already met the requirement, while others are rushing to public issuing houses or waiting on the sidelines. Some banks have taken the step of consolidating through mergers with other banks, aiming to become a mega banking empire. Leading banks are looking to acquire smaller, less healthy ones. UBA and Standard Trust Bank Plc have elevated the merger trend to new heights, becoming the largest bank on the West Africa Coast. With Mr. Tony Elumelu at the helm, known for his determination, this consolidation is likely just the beginning until he achieves presiding over the largest bank in Africa.

To underestimate the significance of a nation's banking system is to undermine its economic well-being. The banking sector serves as the engine of a country's economic activities, impacting economic growth and development. Banks play a vital role in various sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, real estate, and international trade. For nations like the G8 countries, their banking systems are well-established, while developing countries like Nigeria are still in a transitional phase. Consolidation in the banking sector represents a significant and groundbreaking economic leap for our country, potentially kickstarting our journey towards development.

The impact of bank capitalization on real estate is a subject of debate among experts. Some argue that real estate will remain unchanged, as banks may not allocate more funds toward real estate development. Others suggest a moderate change, considering external factors like the Land Use Act that influence real estate growth. A more radical viewpoint anticipates a revolution in the real estate sector, driven by changes in the banking sector.

Each opinion holds merit, emphasizing the need for decisive action. Real estate thrives in high-activity environments and is averse to economic downturns. The capitalization of banks is expected to have a direct and indirect impact on real estate, as banks invest in the sector, and overall economic growth benefits real estate indirectly.

For real estate to flourish, there must be a balance between supply and demand. Real estate suffered in the past due to economic depressions and inadequate funding, leading to a stagnation in development. The resurgence of real estate in the mid-nineties was fueled by growth in the banking sector, although it was later marred by financial distress. The current real estate boom is demand-driven, catering to the needs of immigrants and expatriates.

Looking ahead to the post-capitalization era, increased funding in the banking sector is expected to boost economic activities across various sectors. This growth will enhance purchasing power, stimulating demand for real estate. Improved availability of mortgages and lower interest rates will further drive real estate development, fulfilling housing dreams for many individuals.
