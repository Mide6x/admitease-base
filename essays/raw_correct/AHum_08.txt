**Purpose of Islamic Law**

Islamic law is designed to guide human conduct and provide a set of general principles for life, while leaving technical matters like science and technology to human expertise. The Prophet of Islam, in his wisdom, suggested that people are more competent to devise technical means for worldly matters. Thus, Islamic law is not concerned with how to build a car or a nuclear station, but with establishing the direction for these activities based on virtue and morality.

The overarching purpose of Islamic law is to shape human life by promoting good (Ma'aruf) and eliminating evil (Munkar). It defines what is good and virtuous, as accepted by human conscience, and forbids what is considered evil. Islamic law strives to promote virtues while removing obstacles to the practice of virtue. This is achieved by prohibiting vice and creating measures to prevent its growth in society.

Moreover, Islamic law aims to secure justice, equality, liberty, and fraternity. It focuses on promoting peace, security, and the welfare of individuals and society as a whole. By purifying the soul (tazkiat al-Nafs), it guides individuals toward selflessness, encouraging them to act in ways that benefit others, rather than pursuing selfish desires.

The Qur'an stresses that true righteousness lies not in superficial actions, but in having faith in Allah and performing deeds such as charity, prayer, and fulfilling contracts. Islamic law encourages justice and accountability in all matters, balancing individual rights with societal needs.

Islamic law also advocates for a balance between stability and change. It recognizes that law must be adaptable to societal needs, and employs principles such as the rule of necessity and need to address life’s emergencies while maintaining its divine essence. The law is flexible enough to permit exceptions in times of necessity (e.g., allowing the consumption of prohibited items in life-threatening situations).

Finally, Islamic law is a synthesis of individual and collective interests. It does not view the individual or the community as separate but aims to harmonize both. Islamic law shapes a society where the moral and legal directives align with the values of good and the avoidance of evil, guiding people toward a prosperous, harmonious life.

**Islamic Law and Morality**

The relationship between law and morality in Islam is inseparable. All those who submit to Allah's will, Muslims, accept His guidance as supreme, acknowledging His moral classification of good and evil. Thus, Islamic law (Sharia) integrates both legal and moral directives, regulating all aspects of life—from family relations to social, economic, and political affairs.

Sharia is a complete way of life, not just a legal system. It cannot be enforced in isolation, as its true purpose is to be applied in the broader context of an Islamic way of living, encompassing both personal and collective duties. Enforcement of the law is achieved through individual conscience, societal pressure, and, when necessary, through legal means.

By adopting the full Islamic system of life, the legal aspects of Sharia can be properly implemented, promoting a just and righteous society.
