Equipping Indigenous Languages and Indigenizing 
    Information Communication Technology: Principles, Processes, and Challenges
When a language is expected to take on a new role and increased responsibility, it must undergo language empowerment to enable it to handle these new functions effectively. Language empowerment, as conceptualized by Omachonu (2007), should be viewed as a language development strategy that involves comprehensive language planning, management, and maintenance. In the following discussion, we will focus on corpus and status language planning, as well as effective language policy implementation in Nigeria. It is important to first differentiate between corpus and status planning. In the field of Sociolinguistics, a useful distinction is often made between these two concepts. Corpus planning pertains to changes in language structure: vocabulary, syntax, morphology, orthography, or the adoption of a new script. On the other hand, status planning involves a language's position in relation to other languages, or the language requirements of a political or public authority (Ndukwe, 1988). In essence, corpus planning aims to develop and standardize a language, equipping it to fulfill all possible functions within a specific speech community, while status planning alters the functions of the language and the rights of its speakers. Experts suggest that corpus planning encompasses various linguistic activities such as orthography development, vocabulary expansion, dictionary compilation, script and spelling reform, creation of educational materials, literature, terminology development, language revival, translation, among others (Agbedo, 2000; Emenanjo, 2005; Anagbogu, 2005; Bamgbose, 2006).

In addition to these conceptual explanations, it is significant to note that language planning in Africa is often synonymous with language standardization, a perspective we will adopt in this discourse. Moreover, our focus languages in this context should include the three major Nigerian languages and other significant languages. This development could be phased or carried out simultaneously, especially for states with both major and main languages to address. The differentiation between major and main languages becomes essential, as highlighted by Jubril in Omachonu's work (2000: 1):

The major languages - Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba - are rightfully the predominant languages spoken in Nigeria, designated for study in the Nigerian Education System following the 1981 National Policy on Education with regard to mother tongue education. However, alongside these three are languages dominant in their respective states by virtue of population and recognition, which are considered main languages.

These identified languages are already designated for use in all formal educational processes, including science and technology. By meeting this criterion, they fulfill a critical aspect of language standardization called determination, which involves selecting a language or medium in a multilingual nation to fulfill specific functions in regional, national, and international communication. To meet these roles effectively, these languages must meet specific language corpus requirements for standardization, involving modernization, elaboration, cultivation, etc., as we will elaborate further. Wolff (2000) outlines the steps or requirements of corpus planning as codification, elaboration, implementation, cultivation, and harmonization, in addition to determination as discussed earlier. He summarizes these requirements by stating, "There must be codification in terms of standard orthography, a reliable reference grammar, a comprehensive monolingual dictionary, sufficient and adequate reading materials, and teacher training manuals." The targeted indigenous languages must possess all these elements to transition successfully from English as the medium for education and the acquisition of general knowledge and skills.

For these languages to be utilized in a wider range of domains, as proposed, proper and standardized codification/graphic representation, considering the principles of effective orthography (accuracy, convenience, consistency, familiarity, harmonization), is vital. Vocabulary expansion is also necessary, involving the elaboration of appropriate terminology for commercial, professional, and scientific domains as knowledge and technology progress (Omachonu, 2000: 19; Wolff, 2000: 337). Strategies for vocabulary expansion, such as extra-language borrowing, coinages, meta-language development, calquing, and intra-language borrowing, among others, can enrich the selected language for this purpose. Effective harnessing and management of achievements in codification, elaboration, and vocabulary expansion can streamline harmonization, which simplifies symbols to facilitate printing and teaching. With the right approach, consistent training, and re-training of qualified teachers, along with the establishment of a regulatory body for standardization, stability, and cultivation, can be achieved over time.

The Nigerian society, with its unique languages and culture, should take charge of its destiny by actively promoting a distinct Nigerian identity and indigenous technology knowledge for meaningful development. This endeavor should include integrating science and technology to the extent that electronic communication devices such as television, radio, computers (including the internet and Encarta Premium suite), and even G.S.M. handsets are programmed in African/Nigerian languages, with instruction manuals and menus coded in these languages. To achieve this in the process of indigenizing ICT, designing appropriate keyboards for representing Nigerian languages is essential. Progress in this direction is evident, such as the initial development of a font for Nigerian languages by Victor Manfredi on behalf of the Linguistic Association of Nigeria (LAN) in 1985, later expanded to include symbols of other major West African languages and renamed PanKwa. Although this innovation faces challenges, it has addressed issues that previously hindered typesetting for Nigerian languages, particularly in electronic document processing. With continued efforts and growing interest in ICT, these challenges can be overcome.

As previously suggested, any meaningful language empowerment initiative must encompass both corpus and status dimensions of language planning. The status dimension focuses on language policy formulation and implementation. However, the primary challenge faced by our nation is not policy formulation but implementation. Implementation is the driving force that translates policies into practical applications in language-specific contexts. National language policy, especially in education, has encountered setbacks primarily due to inconsistencies, neglect, or a lack of commitment to faithful implementation. Our efforts in this regard, since independence, have often remained on paper without the necessary determination and commitment for implementation. It is imperative that we break this pattern in our national life, embracing best practices to ensure successful outcomes. It is crucial to emphasize that without diligent implementation, all efforts in language development risk remaining theoretical.

The Real Problem with Us: Speaking Candidly to Ourselves
In addition to the challenges of language endangerment and linguistic deficiencies in our indigenous languages, as well as the lack of commitment to implementing policies, we also face a psychological barrier that has kept us stagnant. According to Maduka (2007), the colonial experience has had a profound negative impact on Nigerian cultural life, leading to self-alienation and internal conflict among educated Nigerians. The enduring legacy of colonialism has distanced individuals from their language and cultural heritage, fostering a false sense of inferiority and psychological inadequacies. This self-destructive mentality permeates all aspects of life, including the devaluation of indigenous languages and culture, hindering progress in national development. It is disheartening to observe that even today, many educated Nigerians take pride in their proficiency in English while disregarding their mother tongue. As Ngugi (2008:1) aptly puts it, "He measures his modernity by the distance he has been able to establish between himself and his native tongue," a sentiment that resonates across the African continent. Such individuals shun their native language, viewing it as archaic and primitive, proudly proclaiming their ignorance of it to the world.

Africa, and Nigeria in particular, is not unique in experiencing the repercussions of colonialism. However, what sets Nigeria apart is the lack of resolve to break free from the shadow of colonialism and its detrimental effects on our languages. Other nations, like Finland, Vietnam, and Wales, faced similar challenges but chose to fight for the preservation of their indigenous languages out of national pride and resilience. English itself underwent significant transformations due to historical conquests, yet its evolution into an international language was driven by individuals' patriotism and collective determination. Nigerian languages can draw inspiration from the development of English, incorporating beneficial practices without jeopardizing their own linguistic heritage.

Conclusion
For sustainable national development and economic prosperity in Nigeria, we require intellectual capital - creative and intellectual abilities - to revitalize our economy. This can be best achieved by leveraging indigenous languages for comprehensive education. Language plays a pivotal role in ethical transformation and national progress, with indigenous languages offering a more accessible path to acquiring essential knowledge for advancing the economy and society.
