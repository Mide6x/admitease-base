Tips and Tricks for Personal Style

Your choice of clothing style, whether it's high street, runway, hippie, street style, sassy, old school, or African, should complement your appearance, personality, and lifestyle. Always keep in mind that simplicity is key.

Add your unique touch to what you feel comfortable wearing. While you may admire Beyonce's outfits in her music videos, they may not necessarily enhance your personal style.

Avoid splurging all your money on designer and pricey items. Mix high street fashion pieces with more expensive items. You can find affordable clothing that, when combined thoughtfully, can make you look like a million bucks.

Style should be driven by creativity rather than brand names or trends. It should be about what suits you and complements your body. Attention to detail may not cost much but can significantly enhance your style.

Some quick personal style tips:

- Keep your outdated clothes as they may come back in trend in the future.
- Experiment with colors that you love, but avoid clashing colors.
- Your handbag, belt, and shoes do not have to match perfectly. They should complement each other without being identical. Instead of sticking to designer labels, mix them with lesser-known brands.
- Revamp old outfits with fashion accessories like jewelry, scarves, belts, shoes, and bags.
- Introduce bold-colored clothing, shoes, and bags to your wardrobe to mix and match with your existing pieces.

There are endless possibilities to experiment with fashion without breaking style rules. Style is not about being perfect; it's about being true to your personal style. Always remember that fashion is ever-evolving. What remains constant is how you blend the right pieces with your unique personality.
