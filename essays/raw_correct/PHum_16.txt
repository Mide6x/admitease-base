‘A Passion for Embossing Art’
For a significant period, embossing art in Nigeria appeared to have faded into obscurity. However, there are indications that the popularity that this aspect of visual art once enjoyed in these regions will soon make a comeback.

Mrs. Bola Oyetunji is one of the artists who loves and specializes in embossing art, entering the art world with the sole purpose of promoting and safeguarding this art form. "I create art through metal embossing. Yes, I consider myself a professional artist, despite lacking formal training in art. I did not attend an art school. However, I received training for the type of work I do. My training began in Southeast Asia, specifically Brunei, where I was on an international assignment with my husband. While in Brunei, a woman volunteered to teach us various art forms to keep women engaged, leading to the establishment of an Arts and Crafts workshop. As I have always been passionate about art created by hand, I eagerly joined the workshop. It was during this training that I was introduced to metal embossing, copper tooling, flower crafting, batik, dressmaking, and more."

This training in 1982 prepared Oyetunji for the challenges ahead. Despite holding a Higher National Diploma (HND) in Health Records, her passion for art, instilled by her mother, drove her forward. "Although my mother lacked formal education, she adored art. I grew up observing her adorned with tattoos, witnessing her love for art."

With this foundation, Oyetunji immersed herself in the world of art, eventually establishing her own art gallery named Baroyet Art Gallery at 12 Odozi Street, Ojodu, Lagos. She shared, "This gallery is a testament to my profound love for art and my desire to popularize art in this part of Lagos State. Many doubted my choice of Ojodu for the gallery, claiming it is not a hub for art in Lagos. However, someone had to initiate this, and I chose to do so."

Additionally, she received art training at Pratt Fine Arts Centre in Seattle, Washington State, USA. Oyetunji also holds a diploma in Fashion and Textile Designs, allowing her to focus on interior decoration, metal embossing, and related fields. Over the years, her artistic talent has led her to participate in numerous group art exhibitions where her works have been praised for their vibrancy and uniqueness.

Oyetunji has actively engaged with professional organizations to enhance her craft, including The Society of Nigeria Artists (SNA), Arts Zero Group, and the Gallery Owners Association of Nigeria. These affiliations have enabled her to amplify her efforts in drawing attention to art as a means of generating income and creating job opportunities. In her recent art exhibition titled "Home Grown," Oyetunji aimed to emphasize the significance of embossing art in Nigeria.

She expressed, "Embossing art has been a longstanding tradition, particularly in Asia and the Western world. The potential to pioneer a movement that will be a legacy for future generations lies in our dedication to elevate embossing art to new heights in Nigeria's history, primarily using copper sheet. The available designs encompass cultural, religious, wildlife, and floral themes, ensuring satisfaction in any required size. The golden hue of embossed copper sheet lends a unique brilliance to the designed works, making them ideal as corporate gifts, souvenirs, photo frames, or award plaques that can be customized with swift delivery."

Oyetunji's distinctive artworks set her apart from others. She further remarked, "The distinctive appearance of embossed art enhances the aesthetic appeal of homes and offices. This makes the produced artworks desirable acquisitions for individuals and corporate entities. It is my mission and commitment to introduce embossed artworks into every household, office, and establishment seeking modern artistic pieces," she concluded with a satisfied smile.
