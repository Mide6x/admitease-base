The Unexplored Culture of Dance

Various types of music in Nigeria have been influenced by Western culture. Dr. Rasaki Ojo-Bakare, a theater director and choreographer at the University of Abuja, is encouraging Nigerians to take pride in their cultural heritage. Chinyere Okoye writes:

Dance and music are perhaps the two most vibrant forms of Nigerian art. They encompass various folk and popular music genres that rely heavily on strong rhythms provided by numerous drums and percussion instruments. Nigeria boasts a rich cultural heritage derived from the fusion of its diverse ethnic groups with Arabic and Western influences. Music and dance are essential components of Nigerian culture, with each ethnic group having its own unique specialties. Traditional instruments include various types of flutes, trumpets, musical bows, xylophones, wooden clappers, and a wide array of drums.

Dance in Nigeria comes in many forms; Ubakala reflects their value system and aids in conflict resolution while also bringing about change. Ishan stilt dancers don colorful costumes and contort themselves in mid-air. In contrast, the Tiv dance called ajo involves male dancers working in pairs, and another dance features teams of women performing a dance known as icough, composing songs about current events.

Dancers from Ekiti and Yoruba wear head masks during processional dances. The Hausa, who do not view dancing as a craft, categorize their dances into social dancing and ceremonial bòorii dances.

Nigerian culture mirrors the country's multi-ethnic population. Nigerians continue to treasure their traditional languages, music, dance, and literature. Nigeria is home to three major ethnic groups — Yoruba, Hausa-Fulani, and Igbo — along with numerous other ethnic groups. Thus, Nigerian culture is inherently multi-ethnic, placing significant value on various art forms, including ivory carving, grass weaving, woodcarving, leatherwork, calabash art, pottery, painting, cloth weaving, and glass and metal works.

For Bakare, a prominent playwright in Nigeria's third generation, and an associate professor in the Theatre Arts Department at the University of Abuja, participating in Mnet's "Let's Dance" reality television show was a significant step towards celebrating Nigeria's local content on DSTV, powered by Verve. Rasaki frequently tours many countries worldwide to showcase his artistry in stage productions. Over the past 30 years, his creative endeavors have enriched the arts in dance, performance, creation, administration, and theater scholarship.

Currently, he teaches theater, dance, and choreography at the University of Abuja. "Nigerian culture places great importance on treating guests with utmost care and warmth through dance most times. Nigerians enjoy dancing, with soccer, polo, cricket, swimming, and wrestling being popular among the affluent classes. Nigerian culture, dating back 2000 years, stands out due to its diversity," he remarked.

In an email exchange with THISDAY, he expressed that dance is a fundamental aspect of "our cultural expression and is also highly educational. Dance is an art form that typically involves rhythmic body movements set to music, serving as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in spiritual or performance settings.

"Dance is also used to describe non-verbal communication methods between humans or animals, motion in inanimate objects, and certain musical forms or genres. In sports, disciplines like gymnastics, figure skating, and synchronized swimming are akin to dance, while martial arts like karate are often likened to dances.

"Furthermore, I believe Nigerians have learned a great deal from 'Let's Dance.' Our local television stations in Nigeria are not actively promoting our culture through dance. People from other regions are tapping into the benefits presented by our diverse population. MNet recognizes this and has chosen to invest in developing local content for the DStv platform.

"Stations like AIT possess some of this infrastructure. What I am stressing is the importance of taking action. They focus on other areas. Isn't this the same issue we have with Globacom and other telecom companies? Have you ever seen Globacom sponsoring a dance contest or a theater production? No, they are largely focused on sports, neglecting the growth of the cultural industry.

"If Mnet, a non-Nigerian company, is willing to go the extra mile, then our local television stations should also consider investing in such initiatives. They might even do it better than the foreign stations are currently doing," he added.

He emphasized that "the essence of what we define as culture is encapsulated in the art of dance. Dance communicates every aspect of our human lives and, when combined with oral tradition and oral poetry, serves as a tool to transmit tradition and culture from one generation to another. Therefore, besides the economic potential of dance, it is an art form that one can engage in for a lifetime.

"Dance is an integral part of art; flexibility is not just a crucial part of dance but also of the entire dance program. Regardless of your level of involvement in dance — whether major, minor, or as a part-time enthusiast — you can choreograph your own dance steps."

"Let's Dance" represents a profound exploration of Nigerian culture. It offers a unique platform to showcase the richness of our culture, providing an opportunity for dancing couples to immerse themselves in diverse musical cultures while honing their own.

"The audience learned valuable lessons through 'Let's Dance.' Firstly, every dance carries a thematic focus. Secondly, dance is an amalgamation of styles. Thirdly, the love for song and dance is universal across all Nigerian tribes. Fourthly, always put your best foot forward in dance. Fifthly, when dancing, remember to blend good characterization with a high level of carriage. In essence, 'Let's Dance' offers holistic entertainment for Nigerians," he stated.

Dancing has become fashionable and even rewarding to possess more than just a superficial knowledge of dance. Whether in theory or practice, familiarity with dance can be personally fulfilling. Lecturers teaching dance in universities can attest to the complete transformation that dance has undergone.

According to him, "'Let's Dance' enlightens viewers, especially at a time when traditional values seem to be losing their appeal for many, that dance is an integral part of our cultural expression. The show has also revealed Nigerians' passion for dancing.

"'Let's Dance' provides a unique platform to showcase the richness of our culture, promoting unity while participants master their craft."

In conclusion, I urge Nigerians that we are the ones at a loss as we have relegated our culture to the background. It is only by embracing what is inherently ours that we can promote it effectively.

"Your art should serve as a marketing tool for your products. Allow me to use this analogy: Youssou N’Dour and Baaba Maal, the Senegalese musicians, wherever they go, they showcase their Senegalese culture, prompting their global fans to seek out and purchase that cultural material.

"Today, Senegalese fabrics are being sold worldwide, generating foreign exchange for their country. However, when Nigerian artists like P-Squared perform in London or New York, what aspect of our culture or products are they promoting there?

"If Tu-Face were to wear the Abeokuta Adire or the Ange of the Tiv people or another version of Ange from the Idoma people — the one with red and black stripes — to perform in Tokyo, the Japanese would begin to adopt our native fabrics due to their admiration for Tu-Face, and local fabric makers would start earning foreign currency from Tu-Face's actions. This is the transformative power that art holds for people.

"Nigeria has become a country known for jeans and t-shirts. Who popularized this trend? American artists. This foreign culture is what youths learn from television, aspiring to dress like their on-screen idols. They purchase various jeans materials, inadvertently boosting the American textile industry while undermining the Nigerian textile sector.

"Therefore, we have no choice but to reconnect with our culture and traditions to explore how they can drive our economic development, especially now that the world is facing an economic downturn."
