Is Kampala in danger? A few years ago, the cost of Kampala was affordable. Today, it is becoming unaffordable for many Nigerians, especially party-goers who spend a significant amount of money weekly on designer Kampala dresses. Fashion enthusiasts have expressed concerns that unless the economy improves, fabric prices may continue to rise. Fabric dealers are skeptical and fear that if the situation does not improve, it could impact sales and material costs. Dealers in Kampala are among those affected by the financial crisis and have raised concerns about market stability and the future of the business.

Over the years, Adire fabrics (Tie and Dye), also known as Kampala, have received high patronage and are commonly used as party attire for social gatherings across the country. This trend, originating in the Southwest of Nigeria, has now spread nationwide. Akerele Street in Surulere, Lagos State, has become a hub for the fabric in the local and international fashion scenes. The street features displays of various Kampala fabrics in different shades and colors, known as Akerele Adire Market.

During a visit to the market by The Nation, dealers were observed to be classified into different groups based on their roles. There are producers who specialize in creating patterns on fabric, fashion designers who craft new styles, and retailers who sell either raw materials or finished designs. These groups operate their businesses in various ways, utilizing shops, open spaces, or converted parts of residential buildings. However, most operators lamented the decrease in business activities in the area.

The decline in business has led to a decrease in customer traffic and activity on Akerele Street. The high cost of materials has affected the quality and production for fashion designers. The financial crisis and a decrease in material quality have been cited as reasons for the decline in patronage and business activities.

Despite the downturn in business, prices have not decreased. The cost of plain Kampala materials has risen, affecting both customers and businesses. The increase in material prices has led to higher prices for finished products, impacting customers' purchasing decisions. Producers are facing challenges due to the rising costs of raw materials, which are affecting the overall production and pricing of Kampala fabrics.

The situation has also prompted calls for government intervention to support the industry, which holds potential for tourism and commerce. Stakeholders emphasize the need for government assistance to meet international market demands and help young entrepreneurs develop their businesses to meet international standards.
