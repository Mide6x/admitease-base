Who is at risk of developing high blood pressure?
High blood pressure is prevalent, affecting approximately 25 million Nigerian adults, which is nearly 1 in 3. It is particularly common among individuals of African descent, who are prone to developing it earlier in life and more frequently than Caucasians. While many Nigerians may develop high blood pressure as they age, this should not be considered a normal part of the aging process. Middle-aged Africans have a 90% likelihood of developing high blood pressure during their lifetime. Other groups at risk include those who are overweight, individuals with a family history of high blood pressure, and those with prehypertension (blood pressure readings of 120–139/80–89 mmHg).

High blood pressure is more prevalent in the black population compared to whites. It tends to manifest at a younger age and is typically more severe. Furthermore, blacks have a higher mortality rate from stroke and kidney disease than whites. The positive news is that high blood pressure can be managed with treatment. Moreover, lifestyle modifications can aid in both preventing and managing high blood pressure. These modifications include weight loss for individuals who are overweight (even losing 10 lbs can be beneficial), increasing physical activity (such as walking for 30 minutes daily), adopting a healthy eating regimen that prioritizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, reducing salt and sodium intake in food preparation, and consuming alcohol in moderation. If lifestyle adjustments alone do not effectively control blood pressure, there are various medications available to assist.
