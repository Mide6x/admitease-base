1.2 Focus of the Study
Phonology studies the sound system of languages and aims to demonstrate the patterns of distinctive sounds found in a language. It enables making general statements about the nature of sound systems found in languages worldwide. It is also concerned with the range and functions of sounds in specific languages, as well as with the rules that can be written to show the types of phonetic relationships that connect and differentiate linguistic units (Crystal, 1991:261). The Phonological Rules of a language mainly address its phonological processes and the distinctive features of its segments. Understanding phonological processes and distinctive features enables capturing a significant aspect of a language's phonology.

A Phonological Rule, as defined by Trask (1996:273), is "any rule which, in some analysis, is posited as involved in deriving a pronunciation." It deals with rules that draw on morphological and lexical information as well as phonetic (allophonic) rules. Phonological Rules also transform phonological representations into phonetic forms by precisely explaining the conditions under which a phonological process occurs. This can be expressed in terms of classes of sounds to which the rules apply, and these classes of sounds can be described in terms of features that compose them. For example, a Phonological Rule in English might state that a consonant is palatalized when it occurs before a front vowel and can be written as follows:

Many other rules like this can be identified in English or any other natural language through meticulous study. When studying a language's Phonological Rules, it becomes easier to recognize the distinctive features of the language's segments. This is particularly valuable as there is limited literature providing an in-depth explanation or exploration of a language's Phonological Rules. This research aims to facilitate the documentation and establishment of Phonological Rules in Anaang, a Lower Cross Language spoken in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.

1.3 Background Information on the Anaang People
The term "Anaang" refers to both the language and ethnic group of the people. This section and the following section provide information about the Anaang people as well as the Anaang language.

1.3.1 Origin and Migration
Historically, the Anaang people, along with other Bantus, are believed to have originated from the central Benue valley in Nigeria and migrated through the Northern sector of the Cross River to the Enyong Creek. They proceeded through the present-day Eastern Ibibio land (Ikono) before settling at the location of present-day Abak (Greenberg, 1963, cited in Nyarks, 2002:21). Essien (1983:5-6, cited in Nyarks, 2002) argues that life had existed along the banks and valleys of the rivers and in Cross River thousands of years before the Bantus migrated to that region. According to Essien, the Anaangs' origin can be traced to Ibom, near Aro North-West and East of the Cross River along the highlands of Cameroon. He notes that the Anaangs had been there for many thousands of years before the Cameroonians settled in the area.

In their quest for a new location to unify and preserve their identity, the Anaangs migrated from the Cross River coast to Abak, passing through Eket, Oron, and Western Nsit where some settled. Udoh (1983:9) notes that the roots of various settlements like Afaha Eket in Eket Local Government Area, Afaha Ikot Ebak in Essien Udim Local Government Area, Afaha Obong in Abak Local Government Area, Afaha Nsung in Okobo Local Government Area, Afaha Nsit in Nsit Ibom Local Government Area, and many others could be traced back to a common origin. They consider all Afaha people as blood relatives (imaan). Esema (2002:7), supporting this account, mentions that the Anaang people adhere to the adage, "Afaha Ikidde Afaha ikpa ekong," which translates to mean that an Afaha man will not harm a fellow Afaha man.

Despite oral traditions, and during an interview with Dr. C.T. Udoh, a seasoned Historian, it is maintained that the Anaangs have always resided in their current location, having dispersed from Abak. Both oral and written records agree that the present Anaang counties and councils are a result of migration from Abak. Forde and Jones (1967:83, cited in Nyoyoko, 1997:9) provide a detailed account of the Anaang society originating from a single society or group of villages near the present Abak Local Government Area headquarters. Each of these villages is considered a parent village from which new settlements spread in various directions. Ancestors are said to have come from Ikot Imo in Abak Local Government Area, with traditions identifying the place of secondary dispersal with Afaha Obong. 

1.3.2 Location and Population
In Nigeria, the Anaang people are located in Akwa Ibom State, in the South-South region of the country. They constitute the second-largest ethnic group in Akwa Ibom State, occupying the Northwestern part of the state with a total land area of 2.73 square kilometers and an average population density ranging between 600 and 800 people per square mile (Nyoyoko, 1997:9, Michael and Obot, 2001:14). According to the 1991 census, the Anaang population numbers approximately 1 million (Connel, 1991:8; Urua, 1996:51; Grimes, 2000:167). Udondata (2006:2) estimates the Anaang population at 4 million, although the source and date are not specified. The 2006 census results indicate a total Anaang population of 2.4 million as reported by the National Population Commission.

They are bordered in the North by the Isogbo Igbo (Abia State), in the West by the Ngwas (Abia State) and Ndoki (Rivers State), and in the South, East, and Northeast by the Ibibios. The Anaangs inhabit eight of the thirty-one Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Akwa Ibom State, namely: Abak, Essien Udim, Etim Ekpo, Ikot Ekpene, Obot Akara, Ika, Oruk Anam, and Ukanafun.

1.3.3 Nomenclature:
The term "Anaang" was first mentioned in 1854 by Sigismund Wilhelm Kolle, a German missionary in Sierra Leone, in his book "Polyglotta Africana," where he reported that Anaang was one of the languages spoken by liberated slaves in Sierra Leone (Udoh, 1983:83). It is noteworthy to mention that the spelling of the name was originally "Annang." Following Sigismund Koelle's usage in 1854, this spelling has persisted until the 21st century. Some linguists and non-linguists prefer to write it as "Anaang." Based on Lower Cross phonology, the pronunciation of "Annang" would be /unclear/, while that of "Anaang" would be /unclear/. Even a child in the early stages of speech development would acknowledge hearing adult natives pronouncing the latter, not the former. Therefore, "Anaang" (rather than "Annang") better reflects the native speakers' pronunciation of the name. Hence, the usage of Anaang is favored in this work.

According to Udoh (1983:2) and Umana (2002:1-2), the name "Anaang" is derived from the characteristic behaviors of a tribe known for being resolute, indignant, intolerant, and vindictive. Udoh (1983:99), who believes that Anaang is part of Ibibio, explains that "Anaang" is derived from the Ibibio words Anaanga (to be intoxicated with alcohol), Anaang Ide (to be intoxicated with bravery), and Unnang (black dyed raffia worn by Ekpo Onyoho masqueraders). He interprets "Anaang" to mean 'wild' or 'warrior,' as the Anaangs engaged in numerous battles against the Ngwa Igbos to defend their farmlands and territories.

1.3.4 Ethnic Affinity
As previously mentioned by Udoh (1983:99), there is a belief that Anaang is part of Ibibio. However, Udoh (1983:2) notes that Anaang and Ibibio share common dialects and intermarriage traditions while not being part of each other. Due to this commonality, the colonial masters and missionaries classified the ancestors of the Anaangs and Ibibios as one race or family group. One Colonial District Officer in Abak District, Mr. S. E. Johnson, noted in 1932 that the Anaang sub-tribe seemed to have had the latest contact with Europeans as they were the last area in the Calabar Province to be opened up by the Government (Udoh, 1983:84). Despite colonial claims, some Ibibios still strongly believe that Anaang is a sub-tribe of Ibibio. To support his claim, Udoh (1983:86) quotes an Anaang anthropologist stating that "it is generally believed that the entire group now forming the Southeastern state belongs to the Bantoid group... the Anaang have the same history of migration as the Efik-Ibibio." This suggests that the Anaangs, Efiks, and Ibibios may have migrated
