36. The Teller in the Tale: Reading Modernist Narrative Strategics in the Novels of Biyi Bandele-Thomas

Introduction
Despite the vast critical commentary on the African novel, there is hardly any in-depth study of the modernist trend within the African literary context. Critics have continuously waged wars with wit from either the socio-cultural or the socio-historical perspectives. Discourse on the African novel is often geared toward Africa’s colonial history—undoubtedly the major reason for the contraction of the African identity, which the first generation of African novelists attempted to rehabilitate. On other occasions, critics assess Africa’s disillusionment with independence, which leaves the continent in a dangling state, marred by contradictions, problems, and a litany of crises that signpost Africa’s compromised economy. A summation of these thematic concerns suggests why Charles Nnolim contends that “African literature in the 20th century thus operated on a narrow canvas” (2).

Most critics are hasty to conclude that modernism is merely a response to the decaying conditions of modern life. Although this ideological standpoint is valid, this discourse argues instead that modernism is an imaginative response to the impossibility of being original—assessing the modernist injunction to "make it new" not as a defense mechanism, but as a creative and innovative impulse.

Modernism, as a concept, has a Western ancestry and reached its artistic pinnacle during the first quarter of the twentieth century. It stood at the commanding height of the world at the dawn of that century—a time that ushered in a new world order, shocking and frightening to mankind. Indeed, Virginia Woolf, as echoed in Douglas Hewitt (1988), was prompted to remark that “on or about December 1910 human nature changed” (1). Through this vivid hyperbole, Woolf meant to suggest a frightening discontinuity between the traditional and the shaken present, and that the line of history had been bent, perhaps broken.

Modernist literature assumes that human nature indeed changed—probably decades before Woolf’s specified date. At the dawn of the twentieth century, cataclysmic developments sent the world reeling from its idyllic balance. Since literature heavily relies on all segments of the human community for its subject matter, a review of these historical events will explicate the reasons for the emergence of modernism. Among these events, the two World Wars were the most devastating and served as major accelerators in the evolution of human history.

Moreover, because of its complex nature, modernism continues to defy easy definition. Nevertheless, issues like primitivism, formalism, and alienation are among the seminal and incongruent categories through which critics attempt to organize modernist expression. The term “modernism” refers to a paradigm shift in aesthetics and cultural sensibilities, reflected in the art and literature of the post–World War I period. The ordered and transparent worldview of the nineteenth century was truncated, and the chaos engendered by two World Wars cast the world into despair.

Modernism marks a distinctive break—rejecting Victorian bourgeois morality and abandoning nineteenth-century optimism. It presents a glaringly pessimistic picture of a culture in disarray. It embraces disruption, rejects simple realism, and questions conventional art forms. This is what sets modernists apart from 19th-century artists like Dickens and Tolstoy, who, though critical at times, still believed in societal progress. Modernists increasingly saw traditional forms and social arrangements as obstacles to progress. The artist, therefore, was recast as revolutionary—one who overthrows rather than enlightens.

Alan Munton defines modernism as “a radical dissatisfaction with the commonsense view of the real” (12). This ‘radical dissatisfaction’ informs Allan Friedman’s description of the structure of the modernist novel:

“The structure of the novel gradually underwent a change from the structure of a ladder to the structure of a cobweb. Second, energy of the novel shifted from a polar distribution between its two centres—the individual self and the social world—to an unbalanced concentration on the self” (416).

It is the anatomy of the modernist novel that provokes David Jones’ description of the concept as the literature of “newness” (109). Considering the cataclysmic upheavals and the anarchical ambiance that revolutionized the novel at the dawn of the twentieth century, and the general breakdown in agreement about continuity and order in society, Jose Ortega dubbed the concept “the dehumanization of art” (213). Modernism hinges heavily on radical innovation and experimentation. Herein lies its complexity.

The Modernist Tradition in the African Novel
Without any anticipatory doubt, Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart is about the first African novel that garnered international recognition. However, by 1958, when the novel hit the bookstands, modernism had passed its vintage period. It was no longer as vibrant as when it gained currency. Nevertheless, the title of Achebe’s novel was coined from the modernist tradition, yet most critics fail to observe the emergence and entrance of the modernist ethos into the African artistic canvas.

Achebe’s second novel, No Longer At Ease, is likewise informed by the chaos of the twentieth century. By the time Ayi Kwei Armah’s debut novel, The Beautiful Ones Are Not Yet Born, was published, it had become glaring that African writers were beginning to adopt the modernist mode of writing. Achebe condemned this novel, arguing that Ghana is not a modern existentialist society. He asserted that the book is “sick, not with the sickness of Ghana, but with the sickness of the human condition” (26).

Like Western writers, who artistically documented the cataclysmic developments of their world, colonialism and the post-independence conditions in Africa became the apocalyptic moments that spurred African writers—especially those labeled within the second phase of the African novel’s evolutionary process.

The general discontent with colonial rule led to the clamor for independence or self-rule. Hope and anticipation for independence were wrongly interpreted as a panacea for the many years of colonial subjugation and brutality. However, when independence finally arrived, it was a shocking reality to most African states that there was no going back—no rediscovery of pre-colonial purity or innocence. Coupled with this stunning reality were the neo-colonial tendencies of emergent African leadership.

Charles Nnolim contends that the Nigerian “modernist” trend may have developed independently of European influence and might have emerged from the use of fantasy and exaggerations—staple elements of our folklore (64). He further identifies Amos Tutuola as one of the major precursors in Nigeria.

Biyi Bandele-Thomas' voice can be located within the third generation of Nigerian novelists. He has contributed to a renewed efflorescence of the novel in Nigeria. His novels The Man Who Came in from the Back of Beyond and The Sympathetic Undertaker and Other Dreams are not widely known in Nigeria, largely due to the lack of critical engagement. However, this critical neglect does not imply that Bandele-Thomas’ contribution to Nigerian literature is marginal.

His modernist novels employ scatological imagery to portray Nigeria’s moral and physical decay. The books are morbidly vivid, with narratives woven around excrement and blood, which play vital roles in the protagonists' development. These recurring images could almost be seen as collateral within the narratives, saturating the texts. Bandele-Thomas’ novels are carefully constructed around symbols such as the railway station, train, blood, and the sewage system—central to the experiences of characters like Nuye Odum, Rayo, and Baba Ayafe.

Although this discourse focuses on the narrative strategies employed by Bandele-Thomas, it is imperative to highlight the features of a modernist text:

i. Perspectivism – The locating of meaning from the viewpoint of the individual; the use of narrators embedded within the action of the fiction, experiencing from a personal, particular (as opposed to omniscient, “objective”) perspective; the use of multiple voices, contrasts, and contestations of perspectives;
