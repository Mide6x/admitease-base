Staff

A unique responsibility of anyone tasked with managing university education in Nigeria, or anywhere else for that matter, is the significant task of overseeing a vast pool of human resources. The true quality of a university is determined by the caliber of its staff, both academic and non-academic. Universities are institutions of learning and scholarship where the highest standards are expected. Ideally, staff, particularly academic staff, should be inspired by the loftiest ideals of scholarship and conduct. This inspiration is fostered by providing the necessary equipment and facilities for work and ensuring that they receive salaries that allow them to focus all their energies on teaching and research. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in Nigeria over the last two decades. The unfavorable working environment and inadequate salaries have resulted in a brain-drain phenomenon. Furthermore, a more detrimental effect has been the almost complete erosion of moral consciousness and commitment to the ideals of the teaching profession. Much of what used to be considered normal university culture has vanished, and there is now a disturbing level of misconduct among staff.

The imperative to redirect and motivate staff back to the core vision and mission of the university is a crucial duty of those managing university education at this time. The temptation to pursue quick and easy money by exploiting students has diverted the attention of many academic staff from research. Even in challenging times, universities must strive to remain at the forefront of knowledge creation and contribution. University education should be managed in a way that ensures high-quality teaching is conducted, and research equipment is provided. These are the fundamental purposes of universities.

To enhance efforts to uphold quality research and stay abreast of current scholarship, Nigerian universities should take the establishment of linkages and exchange programs with African and overseas universities seriously. Any university that falls behind in this aspect is at risk of stagnation. The recruitment and retention of high-quality academic staff demand critical attention as endeavors are made to reposition our universities for optimal performance. The declining interest in academia among bright undergraduates and the secondary focus on teaching and research by many lecturers should raise concerns.

The delicate relationship between the staff and management should be a primary concern for university managers. University staff are vocal, assert their rights, understand the rules, and demand conscientious welfare packages. While management must ensure discipline and staff performance, university leadership should maintain an open administration that resonates with everyone. The tensions within universities often stem from preferential treatment given to certain staff members, indicating a lack of even-handedness and fairness in leadership.

Students

Students constitute the largest segment of the university community and are a key reason for the establishment of universities. Their experiences in the university serve as a litmus test for the effective management of university education. They are vulnerable, recipients of education, and their quality partly determines the success or failure of the system. Students are impressionable, critical, and sometimes challenging to manage, making student management an integral part of the university's vision. A concerning aspect of student management on campuses is the belief among a few radical and activist students that confrontation with the administration is necessary to assert their presence, often leading to crises and disruptions. Effective university management should acknowledge this tendency and devise strategies to discourage such behaviors.

Students often experience systemic decay from admission to the completion of their programs. The admission process, often tainted by corruption and extortion, presents the first negative impression for many students. Admission practices that introduce distortions must be rectified to uphold the integrity of university education. The frustrations and demonstrations by students often stem from perceived injustices they face.

The government's admission policies should be reviewed, particularly concerning the redefinition of catchment areas that promote ethnicity and hinder national unity. Admission criteria should prioritize merit-based admissions to promote fairness. Efforts to reduce the influence of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) in admissions and allow universities more autonomy in candidate selection should be considered. Addressing examination malpractices, improving student welfare, providing counseling, and enhancing the moral tone of universities are crucial steps to instill discipline among students and eliminate unethical practices.

The prevalence of indiscipline, cultism, and violence on university campuses reflects a breakdown in moral order and the erosion of essential university values. Cultism poses a serious threat to the learning environment and must be tackled through the preservation of university traditions that uphold truth, morality, and academic excellence. Encouraging student travel programs to other universities can broaden perspectives and rejuvenate the university community.

The Unions

The evolution of labor relations in the seventies and eighties significantly impacted Nigerian universities. The emergence of staff unions, such as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), has posed challenges to university management. The presence of student unions, including the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and Student Union Governments (SUG), further complicates the labor landscape on campuses. Managing multiple labor unions within universities requires adept leadership to balance their demands and maintain a conducive learning environment. The unions, at times, raise legitimate grievances but also face issues of mismanagement by some union leaders, leading to disruptions in university operations.
