Once the government decides on privatization, an avalanche of advertising typically follows, and the most eye-catching language is often displayed in both print and electronic media to demonstrate the benefits of deregulating the downstream oil sector. It is promised that social services, such as health and education at all levels, as well as road construction and repairs, will improve considerably. However, when the claims about social amenities are compared with the reality of Nigerian social conditions, the discrepancy is glaring. Any disinterested observer would report this stark contrast, raising the question of what the elaborate electronic and print advertisements have truly achieved.

What seems to have happened, according to some social scientists, is a collusion between independent marketers and the ruling class. Driven by sheer profit motives, the maximization of these profits becomes their psychological pleasure and satisfaction. They operate a "collegiate system" or "fellowship of profiteers," as Kenneth (ibid) calls it, and the helpless consumer is left at their mercy. This situation is not unlike how vehicle spare parts dealers operate in many parts of the country. Through this fellowship, they regulate the activities of fellow dealers to ensure uniformly high prices for their goods. This is clearly an unacceptable form of capitalism.

But what are the consequences of this "collegiate system" of fuel pricing on the economy? Unfortunately, the reformists seem either unaware of the negative side of deregulation, on which so much money is spent on so-called public enlightenment, or they simply gloss over it. Kenneth (2006:5) puts it succinctly:

"In a country where its economic life is tied firmly to petroleum products, the effects of hikes in fuel prices ripple through every sphere of socioeconomic life. Prices of transportation, goods, and services, as well as the running of factories and production, have gone up astronomically."

Quite frankly, this is the language government apologists would prefer to avoid. But we cannot wish away harsh language, because it springs from harsh realities.

5.4 Reduction of Subsidies in Key Sectors like Education and Health

Let us now look at the fourth reform. In our opinion, this reform contradicts the panacea promised by the removal of subsidies on petroleum products. Initially, the promise is made to improve the education and health sectors, but the immediate result is inflation. Then, subsidies on education and health are removed. Clearly, the government is contradicting itself. Universities are set to be privatized, and they will not be allowed to operate alongside private institutions, as we see in the U.S. Along with them, hostels and lecturers' quarters will be privatized, as will teaching hospitals and general hospitals. What will be left? Hapless Nigerians will presumably be put up for privatization too, won’t they? When language is detached from reality, the result is miscommunication and civil disobedience. We must ensure that we do not reach that point. The balance between language and reality, between language and truth, must be maintained to prevent a descent into the chaos depicted in Animal Farm.

What we have been trying to do is sketch— and we can only sketch in this address—the relationship between language and publicly announced government economic reforms. It is not an overstatement to say that the agenda is written in such a manipulated language that it highlights only the economic advantages while obscuring the darker side of the situation. Because the government is aware of this, it has to explain its case in euphemistic and optimistic terms, which may not be shared by other knowledgeable individuals outside the government.

6. Language and Development

Now that we have explored language in relation to the reforms agenda, let us revisit an issue that has long been ignored in this country, one that is just as essential to national development as the reforms agenda itself. The reforms are primarily economic, aimed at transforming Nigeria into what we might call an "African Tiger" in the future. However, we believe these reforms are superficial: they ignore the essential aspects of humanity—flesh, blood, mind, and language. Economic well-being is not the only aspect of national development, which, as Essien (2003b) defines it, is:

"A process of cumulative change resulting from positive forces that raise productivity and real income per capita, create more employment opportunities, and achieve a wider distribution of gains from the change in a nation-state. National development is multi-dimensional, encompassing political, legal, socio-cultural, administrative, and linguistic changes. In all these dimensions, language is a common denominator."

Before we discuss language in relation to development, let us quickly review the non-economic characteristics of developed countries, especially those in the Western world. Politically, developed nations usually have orderly and regulated patterns of change (as demonstrated recently in the United States and the United Kingdom), as well as democratic principles and institutions. They also respect human freedoms, as guaranteed by the United Nations Charter on Human Rights, and uphold the rule of law.

Legally, developed countries have legal institutions, structures, and cultures that dispense justice impartially and assume innocence until proven guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, the executive arm of government typically does not interfere in judicial matters.

Socio-culturally, socio-cultural institutions, practices, and awareness contribute to political stability, national ethos, national identity, and tolerance, among other things.

7. Language, an Unexplained Residual Factor of Growth and Development?

In discussing factors that contribute to national development, Meier (1976:2-5), a radical development economist, speculated that there is an "unexplained residual factor... the unisolated source of growth." We are convinced that this unexplained residual factor is no longer speculative, as we will discuss in the following sections.

7.1 The Role of Language in National Development

If national development, as defined earlier, is a multi-dimensional enterprise, then language plays a significant role in it. Unfortunately, this role has either been taken for granted or completely ignored in this country. What is this role? We will examine it from a general perspective of language in society, its role in developed economies, and the role it can play in Nigeria as a developing and multilingual nation.

7.1.1 The Primary Role of Language

Regardless of how development is defined, one thing is certain: language is a constant, common denominator. No human activity can be imagined without language. Have we ever wondered what our minds would be like without language as we know it? It is so easy to take language for granted that we never stop to imagine a world without it. Language will always be there, and fortunately for humanity, it always has been.

However, in development, because the role of language is often latent, we tend to ignore its power in our programs and strategies. If the authors and implementers of development programs are deficient in their expressive or understanding power of language, the programs themselves will be poorly communicated and poorly understood.

Since humans are inherently both homo sapiens and homo loquens, and since education—a vital element of development—is inconceivable without language, all notions, concepts, theories, arguments, analyses, and practices that enhance national development find expression in language (or its proxy, such as codes). Therefore, the role of language in national development cannot be overemphasized. Man is not an automation; he is flesh, blood, language, and mind through which his thoughts, soul, and spirit can find full expression.

Development programs would, therefore, be seriously flawed— as they have been in Nigeria and other new nations of Black Africa—if language were not considered a major component. As we shall see later, development paradigms outside Black Africa did not ignore language, because this uniquely human possession plays a crucial role in thought, description, analysis, and argumentation, all of which are essential to development.

7.2 Language and Nations

In this section, we will briefly consider the language situations of some developed countries for comparison, instruction, and emulation, where applicable.

7.3 European Nations

It is widely recognized today that very few countries, including those in Europe, are monolingual, even though they may have only one official language. Multilingualism—whether official or not—has become the norm, as more nations understand and embrace democracy. Even countries that may seem monolingual, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, have their own forms of multilingualism (cf Trudgill 1983:14ff). These nations have managed their multilingualism without sacrificing the principle of language rights, which should be instructive for us.

One way European nations have managed multilingualism is through national independence granted to local ethnic minorities. This process has led to the creation of 53 "full-fledged" official and national languages by 1937 in Europe, a number that has only increased since then, thanks to independence and democracy. Each new nation also birthed a new national and official language, becoming an essential expression of identity and aspiration. Governments of these new nations have responded by investing in language planning, which has been a conscious, long-term effort to alter their languages (Weinstein 1980:56).

7.4 Asian Nations

Though records of what the Japanese and Chinese did to their languages are not readily available, we suspect they must have followed similar steps as the Europeans. The Japanese and Chinese languages have always been used for all forms of communication in their respective countries. Asian "Tigers" like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, India, and Indonesia have recognized their indigenous languages as indispensable tools for national development. Language, in our opinion, may indeed be Meier's "unidentified residual factor" in development.

8. Conclusion

In conclusion, we ask, what are the Nigerian reforms introduced by the government ultimately for? A political gimmick? We should think not. To be seen as doing something for the nation? Perhaps. To respond to the demands of the IMF and World Bank?
