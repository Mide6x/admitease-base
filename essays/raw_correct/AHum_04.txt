A New Approach to Address Funding Challenges in Tertiary Education
Given the financial difficulties faced by traditional residential campus-based tertiary institutions, it is imperative to explore a more cost-effective alternative. Drawing from insights gained from similar initiatives in various countries, an effective solution that can address these challenges is the adoption of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) methodologies, supported by innovative information and communication technologies.

The growing necessity for continual learning to enhance skills and competitiveness in rapidly evolving economies has led to a global demand for part-time tertiary education among working adults.

Considering the significant limitations and issues encountered in running conventional tertiary institutions in Nigeria and beyond, it is increasingly unlikely that these countries can expand tertiary enrollments using traditional face-to-face teaching approaches and the prevailing residential campus model, which often leads to disruptions within educational institutions.

With proper management, distance education offers the potential to increase tertiary enrollments at a lower cost per student compared to the traditional residential campus system. The flexibility in curriculum design and delivery inherent in distance education allows for tailored courses that cater to individual student needs and work obligations, thus enhancing relevance.

Distance education can bridge the gap for learners who have been excluded from tertiary education opportunities for various reasons. As the most contemporary form of educational delivery, distance education is rapidly evolving globally, leveraging accumulated experiences to enhance program design effectively.

These advantages have positioned tertiary distance education as the fastest-growing educational sector worldwide. However, Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries are lagging in the adoption and effective utilization of this versatile educational model, primarily due to inadequate infrastructure, technological development, and governmental support, particularly in Nigeria.

Efforts to Address Challenges Through Distance Education
The government has initiated commendable efforts to promote Open and Distance Education in Nigeria since the National Workshop in September 2000, which outlined a practical vision for the role of distance education in addressing educational challenges. Subsequent workshops, such as the one on Developing Materials for Open Distance Education in 2001, have aimed to equip individuals with the skills needed to create high-quality distance learning materials.

To facilitate the successful implementation of National Open and Distance Learning Programs, this submission offers suggestions based on past experiences in Nigeria and successful practices from other countries.

Suggestions for Effective Implementation of the National Open and Distance Learning Project
Structural Framework for Implementation
To ensure the comprehensive implementation of the National Open and Distance Learning program, a well-coordinated decentralized structural framework consisting of three main Regional Zones – Northern, South-Western, and South-Eastern zones – with Regional Headquarters in Kaduna, Ibadan, and Enugu, respectively, should be established. Alternatively, considering the six Geographical Zones may be more effective.

The National Headquarters in Abuja, led by a National Coordinator, will oversee activities, formulate policies, coordinate operations through Regional Zones and States, recruit and train personnel, develop course materials, and provide facilities for program execution.

Technology
Selecting suitable technology is crucial to accommodate constraints such as limited access to telecommunication and electricity among the target population. The technology chosen should be affordable and cost-effective for students.

A hybrid or multi-media approach for delivering distance education programs, combining print media, audio-visual aids, radio cassettes, TV broadcasts, satellite lectures, email, Internet, and other computer applications, is recommended. The provision of essential infrastructure such as electricity is vital for the successful application of these media.

Tutorial Support
Given the importance of human interaction in learning, incorporating tutorial support, possibly through satellite technology with VSAT, can enhance instructional delivery to students at Study Resource Centers. Face-to-face tutorials and examinations during residential periods can further facilitate student-tutor interactions.

Management Choices - Course Selection
To start off effectively, it is advisable to initially offer a selected number of high-quality distance education courses in response to public demand, aligned with the country's employment needs and job market requirements.

Administrative Flexibility
Greater administrative flexibility is essential for tertiary institutions to adapt to evolving educational demands, moving away from rigid traditional systems.

Policies for Capacity-Building
Investing in staff training to equip them with the necessary skills for implementing distance education programs is vital. Partnerships can also be leveraged to enhance capacity-building, focusing on collaboration in instructional material sharing, course development, teacher training, program evaluation, technology utilization, and policy alignment.

Team Approach to Course Development
Forming specialized teams consisting of content specialists, editors, graphic designers, pedagogical experts, librarians, and desktop publishing specialists can enhance the development of distance education courses. Conducting workshops for these teams before initiating course development activities can ensure effective collaboration and production of high-quality learning materials.

Efficient management practices, such as acquiring proven course materials from reputable distance education institutions during the initial phase, can help reduce program costs significantly. Collaborative efforts among institutions can lead to economies of scale and shared resources, enhancing the adoption of advanced technologies like satellite broadcasting services.

By implementing these recommendations, Nigeria can strengthen its Open and Distance Learning initiatives, aligning them with global best practices and local needs to enhance educational accessibility and quality.
