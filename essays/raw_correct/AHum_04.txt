Need to Consider a New Approach
In view of the persistent challenges in funding existing tertiary institutions operating under the traditional residential campus model, there is a pressing need to adopt a more cost-effective alternative. Based on our study of similar developments in various countries, a viable solution is the adoption of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) techniques, supported by a judicious use of emerging information and communication technologies.

The growing demand for lifelong learning, especially to help workers update their skills and remain competitive in rapidly changing economies, has created a global appetite for part-time tertiary education targeted at adults.

Given the serious operational constraints affecting conventional tertiary institutions in Nigeria—as well as in many other countries—it appears increasingly unlikely that Nigeria will be able to significantly expand tertiary enrolment using the current face-to-face instructional methods and the residential campus system, which frequently experience disruptions.

If properly managed, distance education offers the potential to expand access to tertiary education at a lower cost per student compared to the traditional system. Distance learning also provides greater flexibility in course design and delivery, allowing the curriculum to better match learners' specific needs or professional demands, thereby enhancing relevance and impact.

Additionally, distance education has the potential to reach learners who, for various reasons, have been denied access to higher education. As the most modern form of educational delivery, it is growing rapidly across the globe—driven by innovation and the accumulated experience of established institutions. However, in Nigeria and across sub-Saharan Africa, progress in adopting this model remains slow due to infrastructural limitations and insufficient government support.

Efforts Being Made to Solve Problems via Distance Education
Encouragingly, since the National Workshop on Open and Distance Education in September 2000, several positive steps have been taken by the Nigerian government. This workshop outlined a pragmatic vision for how distance education could address the country’s educational challenges. A follow-up workshop on the development of learning materials was held in Abuja from 4–8 June 2001, focused on training professionals to create quality text-based, audio, video, and CD-ROM distance learning materials.

Other initiatives include the Virtual Library Project, the drafting of legal instruments, and blueprint development for the formal launch of a National Open and Distance Learning Project.

Having laid down much of the foundational infrastructure and strategic plans, this submission is intended to offer practical suggestions to support the effective implementation of the National Open and Distance Learning Programmes.

Suggestions for Effective Implementation of the National Open and Distance Learning Project
Structural Framework
A decentralised structural framework is essential. This could be composed of three major regional zones—Northern, South-Western, and South-Eastern—based in Kaduna, Ibadan, and Enugu respectively. Alternatively, Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones could be considered for greater coverage.

The National Headquarters in Abuja, headed by a National Coordinator, would oversee policy formulation, personnel recruitment and training, and the development of course texts and learning facilities. Regional and State Coordinators would then implement the programmes across zones and states.

Technology
The choice of technology must consider infrastructural challenges, including limited access to electricity and telecommunications. Therefore, technological solutions should be affordable, accessible, and cost-effective.

A hybrid or multi-media delivery model is recommended—combining print media, audio-visual aids (e.g., radio cassettes, TV broadcasts), satellite beaming of lectures, and digital tools such as email, the internet, and emerging educational software.

Importantly, interactivity between students and tutors should be prioritized, as it has been shown to significantly enhance learning outcomes.

Tutorial Support
To mitigate the perceived lack of human interaction in distance learning, tutorial support is vital. Satellite-based delivery systems such as VSAT can be used to broadcast learning materials to students at Study Resource Centres. The Distance Learning Institute (DLI) at the University of Lagos already implements a model that includes periodic face-to-face tutorials and a four-week residential session for direct student-tutor interaction and examinations.

Management Choices: Courses to Offer
It may not be feasible to launch all academic programmes at once. A selective approach is advisable—starting with a few high-quality courses that address significant areas of public demand, as determined by a market survey. Course selection should also consider the country’s employment needs and skills gaps.

Administrative Flexibility
Greater administrative flexibility than the traditional system allows is necessary for responding effectively to changing educational needs and learner demands.

Policies for Capacity-Building
Staff training is critical. Building planning and management capacity is particularly important in distance learning, where communication with learners is more complex and costly than in conventional classrooms.

Collaborations and partnerships can strengthen capacity in several areas:

Sharing of instructional materials

Course development

Training of teachers and administrators

Programme evaluation

Technological experimentation

Policy collaboration

Credit transfer and mutual recognition

Joint efforts also help institutions pool limited resources and achieve economies of scale—e.g., shared use of satellite technology for national broadcast services.

Team-Based Development of Course Materials
A team approach is best for producing high-quality distance education materials. A typical course development team should include:

Course Content Specialists: Prepare and write the course modules (usually around 15 modules per course).

Review Editor & Communications Specialist: Review the draft materials for clarity and engagement.

Graphic Designer: Enhance visual presentation of course content.

Pedagogical Specialist / Librarian / Information Specialist: Improve instructional quality and integrate learning resources.

Desktop Publishing Specialist: Prepare final layout and formatting.

Team Leader: Coordinate the team and manage the production schedule.

Before writing begins, a course development workshop should be held to align the team on content format, delivery strategies, and quality standards.

A quality training programme for course developers should include:

Practical training in the design, production, and presentation of materials

Hands-on experience with the relevant delivery technologies

Instruction on how to make courses more human-centric and engaging

Techniques for fostering student participation and interaction

Cost Management and Use of Existing Materials
Producing quality distance learning materials is expensive. Good management can significantly reduce these costs. One effective cost-saving strategy at the start-up phase is to license or adapt existing course materials from reputable distance education institutions.

For example, the University of Lagos' Distance Learning Institute (DLI) has provided course texts used by other institutions in Nigeria and even the Open University of Tanzania during their formative stages.
