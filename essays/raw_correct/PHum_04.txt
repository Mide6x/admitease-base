Artistic Ideals of Araism

Recently, Mufu Onifade and his group of followers hosted an art exhibition at the Mydrim Gallery in Ikoyi, Lagos, titled Araism Movement 5. Since 1996, Mufu, a respected artist, has been exploring Araism, an art movement he founded to promote the principles of visual art techniques.

The core ideals of Araism have consistently focused on techniques rather than style. This emphasis has enabled Mufu to progress in his ongoing search for a unique art form and expression, not only for himself but also for those who support his vision.

The exhibition at the Mydrim Gallery further solidified Araism's influence on the Nigerian art scene, introducing new artists who have embraced Araism as their own. Each artist discovered their authentic voice through the art forms they presented. In one of Mufu's works titled "Iroke," done in acrylic on canvas, he conveyed a profound belief that, like a jingle bell, Iroke produces a distinct sound that communicates a message of clarity inspired by Orunmila's vision. This piece, with its strong appeal and conviction, reinforces the followers' faith and conveys a powerful divine message rooted in sacredness and spirituality.

"Iroke" is best understood and appreciated by true art enthusiasts and those who resonate with Orunmila's ideals. Mufu also created other works such as "Sango's Harem" and "Awelewa," meaning African beauty, all of which delve deeply into Araism's significance, which surpasses superficial interpretations. This demonstrates Mufu's deep commitment to this movement, technique, and form.

Oludotun Popoola also contributed works like "Arewa" (Beauty Within), "Aajo Laye" (The Return), and "Igara," all reflecting the essence of Araism. In "Igara," Popoola illustrates the essence of a traveler's heart, emphasizing that this work transcends ethnicity or immediate surroundings. The piece features a cluster of buildings typical of the Igara area in Edo state, symbolizing man's appreciation for his creations and achievements in a rural setting conducive to inner peace and flourishing.

Jonathan Ikpoza's presentation included works like "Ketekete" (Horse Rider), "Ile Lati Ko Eso Rode" (Charity Begins at Home), and "Obowonkori" (The Sower), each depicting human actions and activities in diverse forms. Ikpoza's art reflects a deep understanding of societal ideals and values, portraying the significance of human presence in shaping the world.

The exhibition featured a total of 14 artists, each showcasing a collection of works that highlight the depth of Araism. Esther Ayodeji Emmanuel, the sole female artist among them, stood out with her statement affirming that "Looking beyond the horizon reveals the true identity of artistic expression." This sentiment is evident in her work "Sleeping on Duty in the Atmosphere of Commerce," emphasizing the importance of rest amidst demanding responsibilities and the consequences of neglecting self-care.

Overall, the artworks are expressive, profound, and thought-provoking, appealing to the soul. It is hoped that through these creations, the principles of Araism technique, which has significantly influenced the visual art profession not only in Nigeria but globally, will continue to inspire innovation and creativity.
