Benefits of Reviving Fixed Line Network

In this report, Efem Nkanga discusses the current efforts by operators in the telecommunications industry, which is predominantly mobile (97%), to establish a robust fixed landline network in the country. This initiative aims to alleviate the strain on the mobile platform.

Recently, Nigerian Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) operators have begun implementing fixed-line services to alleviate the burden on the mobile network. This move is a response to stakeholders' calls for a more balanced ratio, as currently, only three percent of lines are dedicated to landlines.

The demand for fixed lines arose after Nigerians experienced poor service quality, tarnishing the reputation of GSM. This led to a common sight of Nigerians juggling three mobile phones simultaneously to ensure constant communication with loved ones and business associates around the clock.

The prevalence of using multiple phones is not limited to businessmen and government officials but also extends to students. Many Nigerians have resorted to owning multiple SIM cards from different GSM operators to mitigate downtimes and ensure continuous connectivity.

In an effort to reduce pressure on the mobile platform, two major operators have introduced their fixed-line services. This move allows Nigerians to not only make calls on the go but also utilize fixed lines at home or in offices, imitating the communication practices in developed countries where mobile phones are used for mobility.

The widespread use of mobile phones in Nigeria has hindered the popularity of fixed lines. The lack of a robust fixed network infrastructure before the advent of GSM led to the widespread adoption of mobile technology. However, the declining service quality prompted a push for a reliable fixed line network.

Globacom, through its fixed line arm Glo Broad Access, has begun providing commercial fixed-line services to corporate subscribers in Lagos and Abuja. Plans are underway to extend these services to individuals in key cities across Nigeria. The network infrastructure is being established in major cities to cater to the growing demand for fixed-line services.

MTN, a leading telecom operator, has also launched its fixed-line network in Ibadan. The service, known as HyConnect, utilizes fiber optic technology to deliver true fixed services with broadband speeds ranging from 64kbps to 2mbps. This service is a significant advancement in providing high-speed internet and improved call quality to subscribers.

The introduction of a unified licensing regime by the Nigerian Communications Commission in 2006 has created opportunities for operators to offer multiple services under a single license, fostering innovation and competition in the telecom sector. This regulatory framework enables operators to meet market demands by introducing new services without the need for additional licenses.

The expansion of fixed-line services by major operators like MTN and Globacom, along with the anticipated entry of other players like Celtel (now Zain) and NITEL, will bring new innovations and benefits to Nigerian subscribers. Despite the current lower number of fixed-line subscribers compared to mobile users, the shift towards fixed lines is a positive step that is likely to grow in the coming years.

Reducing the strain on the mobile network not only addresses service quality issues but also offers health benefits. Recent concerns about excessive mobile phone usage potentially causing health risks, including cancer, highlight the importance of promoting fixed-line alternatives to safeguard the well-being of Nigerians in the long run.
