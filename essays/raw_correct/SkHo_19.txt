Engaging the Practice Group

If efforts to involve other partners in the implementation of the practice group prove challenging, making a personal appeal to them to refrain from being overly critical during the transition phase can help mitigate any disruptive tendencies. Encourage them to propose ways to maintain a positive and constructive direction for the initiative, recognizing that as professionals, they tend to be highly analytical and critical of new ventures.

As a managing or principal partner, your most potent management tool is your attention. Where you focus your attention, invest your time, and demonstrate priority, is perceived as significant by those who seek your guidance. Therefore, it is crucial to review your schedule and identify practice group meetings you can attend over the next month.

Your presence at these meetings will signal to the practice leader and team members your genuine interest in the initiative. Observing the group dynamics firsthand will provide valuable insights into their reactions and the key issues being addressed. Some firms encourage regular practice group meetings, while others mandate monthly gatherings.

Regardless of your firm's policy, nothing surpasses the enthusiasm generated when the managing partner or a member of the executive committee shows interest in the group's activities by volunteering to attend as an external observer. This not only allows you to monitor the group's progress but also offers an opportunity to contribute valuable ideas. Successful firms often assign various practice groups to different members of the executive committee to distribute the time commitment evenly.

Encourage practice leaders individually to welcome you as an observer at their next meeting. Be an enthusiastic supporter â€“ this is your second most effective tool. Share your observations from attending practice group meetings with other leaders, reinforcing the importance you place on these initiatives and signaling your commitment to their progress.

Following each meeting, send an email to the leader and group members, acknowledging the positive ideas generated and expressing anticipation for the progress to be discussed at the next meeting. This will motivate team members to follow through on their commitments.

Consider establishing a Practice Group Leaders Council to enhance communication and knowledge-sharing among departments, practice groups, and industry teams. These councils typically meet quarterly to review activities and facilitate information flow throughout the firm.

During meetings with practice leaders, celebrate small successes, encourage hesitant leaders to take action, and address cross-cutting issues that may impact multiple practice groups. Conduct biannual progress reviews with all practice leaders to evaluate their advancements, provide feedback on action plans, and suggest strategies for improvement. By scheduling these reviews in advance, you underscore the significance of accountability and tangible results.
