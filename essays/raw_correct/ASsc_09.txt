Migrating Cultural Performances: The Urhobo Among the Ikale-Yoruba

Introduction
This chapter discusses Urhobo rural-to-rural immigrants in Ikale-Yorubaland, focusing on how cultural performances function as significant markers of cultural identity. It also explores how interactions in a context of limited political and economic resources, along with Nigeria's ethnic diversity, can lead to the evolution of new cross-cultural performances. This argument draws from Abner Cohen's insights on the politics of cultural symbols and his recent work on modern cultural movements (refer to Abner 1993).

Urhobo Rural Immigrants in Ikale-Yorubaland
The Urhobo people, with a population of 0.6 million in 1963 growing to approximately 1.1 million by the 1991 census, constitute the largest ethnic group in the former Bendel and current Delta State of Nigeria. They are segmented into twenty-two polities, each distinguished by dialectal variations, micro-political structures, and religious symbols. Most polities are organized around kingship, where the Ovie, the king, is selected either rotationally from descent groups or through primogeniture. Some polities have gerontocratic structures, while others have central institutions led by senior members of title-associations. Each polity comprises several towns and villages, where kinship symbols and sentiments significantly influence indigenous council democracies' character and functioning.

The Urhobo consider themselves a unified people due to shared political, religious, and kinship symbols and a common language. Differentiation levels are marked by the use of symbols and cultural performances. Socio-cultural differences are dramatized and ritualized, playing a crucial role in the political and economic relationships with neighboring ethnic groups, such as conflicts between the Urhobo and Itsekiri ethnic groups in urban areas like Warri and Sapele.

The Urhobo's experience of evolving symbolic identifications, explained through the theory of segmentary opposition, is part of their strategy for coexistence with other ethnic groups outside their territory. Rural Urhobo migrants relocate to areas like Ikaleland in Okitipupa division, a rural Yoruba territory, attracted by the abundant oil palm trees and forest environment for socio-economic sustenance.

Individual males or small male-headed households started migrating to Okitipupa and other parts of Yorubaland from the 18th century, approximately 270 kilometers away from their original homes. Oil palm production, a labor-intensive occupation, necessitates cooperation among men, women, and children. On arrival, Urhobo immigrants established camps or villages, introducing Urhobo culture and expertise in palm oil production to the local Ikale population.

The Urhobo camps in Ikaleland reflect their original Delta State villages but with elements of impermanence, indicating the transient nature of their migration and settlements. The camps maintain Urhobo language, dress forms, and specialized tools, symbolizing their exclusive occupation and economic survival strategies. Urhobo immigrants engage in palm oil production and farming, interacting with Ikale society in marketplaces while preserving their cultural identity and practices in their camps.

The Urhobo migrants' population in Ikale territory varied over the years, with fluctuations influenced by their success in achieving economic targets. The Urhobo, alongside other immigrant groups like Ijo, Igbo, Bini, Isoko, Itsekiri, Hausa, Effik, and Ibibio, represent carriers of distinct cultures in this diverse rural setting.

The Urhobo camps, characterized by the lifestyle of the immigrants, also stand out through their architectural design and structure. Each camp comprises an average of seven family units, governed gerontocratically with ritualized socio-economic authority to ensure cooperation and peace. Oil palm production depends on peaceful collaboration among camp members. The camps' economic activities, predominantly palm oil production, contribute to the immigrants' integration into the local market and society.

The Urhobo migrants engage in cultural performances, particularly igbe religious worship, during their resting days and annual festivals. The igbe religion, originating from Urhoboland, is practiced exclusively by Urhobo immigrants in Ikaleland, symbolizing purity, peace, and joy through rituals, dances, and communal gatherings. Igbe serves as a cultural boundary marker, fostering inner purification and cooperative living among its adherents.
