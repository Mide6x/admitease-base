Cultural Performances in the Migration of the Urhobo among the Ikale-Yoruba

This section explores the migration and cultural integration of Urhobo people into the Ikale-Yorubaland, examining the role of cultural performances as a means of preserving identity and negotiating between ethnic boundaries. The framework builds upon Abner Cohen's theories on the politics of cultural symbols, particularly in multi-ethnic settings like Nigeria, where cultural performances not only maintain identity but sometimes foster new hybrid forms through increasing interactions among groups.

Urhobo Immigrants in Ikale-Yorubaland
The Urhobo, with a significant population growth from 0.6 million in 1963 to 1.1 million by 1991, are the largest ethnic group in Delta State, Nigeria. They are culturally divided into twenty-two polities, each with its own political, religious, and kinship symbols. Despite internal diversity, the Urhobo regard themselves as a unified people, bound by shared language and common cultural symbols.

As the Urhobo migrate, especially from rural parts of their homeland to areas like Ikaleland (in Okitipupa Division), cultural distinctions often become markers of identity, even as they adapt and coexist with the Yoruba hosts. These migrations are motivated by economic opportunities, particularly in oil palm production, which requires cooperative labor and can be done anywhere where oil palms grow. The Ikale-Yoruba region, with its abundance of oil palms, thus serves as a viable destination for Urhobo rural immigrants.

Economic and Cultural Life in Ikaleland
Upon arrival in Ikaleland, Urhobo immigrants settle in small camps or villages, generally composed of about seven households. These settlements, although temporary in nature, are structured according to Urhobo cultural norms. The immigrants carry with them their specialized knowledge of oil palm cultivation and processing, a practice that was previously unfamiliar to the local Ikale population.

The Urhobo engage in a strict daily routine centered around the production of palm oil, a task that involves the entire family. The use of specialized tools, such as rope girdles and custom-made knives, further solidifies their distinct cultural identity. Despite their close economic ties with the Ikale—trading palm oil and other products in local markets—the immigrants maintain their traditional Urhobo lifestyle and language.

Social Organization and Governance
The Urhobo immigrants establish a gerontocratic social structure within their camps, where the eldest male has ritualized authority over family matters, including resolving conflicts. This system ensures the peaceful and cooperative operation of the oil palm production process, which is critical for economic survival in the region.

Over time, some immigrants have successfully transitioned to urban enterprises, setting up businesses in nearby towns like Okitipupa. However, the camps themselves remain largely isolated from the broader commercial life of the area, serving primarily as residential zones for Urhobo people.

Cultural Performances and the Igbe Religion
One of the most significant ways in which the Urhobo maintain their cultural identity in Ikaleland is through their religious practices, particularly the igbe worship. Originating in the Urhobo homeland, this religion was brought by the immigrants to their new settlement. The igbe religious practices are centered around community gatherings on their rest day, edewo, where members, dressed in white, engage in dancing, singing, and spiritual rituals.

The igbe worshippers perform rituals throughout the day, often involving spirit possession and prophesies that provide drama and a sense of community. The edewo gatherings, which include feasting and giving offerings to their spiritual leader, are an important part of Urhobo cultural expression in Ikaleland. While igbe worship is voluntary, it offers spiritual and social benefits, including protection from witchcraft and the alleviation of health problems through herbal remedies.

The religious practices, including the annual festivals and the sacred dances, serve as both a means of social cohesion among Urhobo immigrants and a way to showcase Urhobo culture to their Yoruba hosts. The igbe religion, though not competing with local Yoruba beliefs, becomes a central cultural marker that helps the Urhobo maintain their identity in the host society.

Conclusion
The Urhobo's migration to Ikaleland is a story of cultural preservation and adaptation. Through cultural performances like the igbe religious practices, the Urhobo not only maintain their cultural identity but also create new forms of cross-cultural interaction. These performances serve as vital expressions of solidarity and identity for the Urhobo community, while also contributing to the broader social and cultural landscape of Ikaleland.
