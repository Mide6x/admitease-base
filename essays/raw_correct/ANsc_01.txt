Summary
Background:
Fluoroquinolones are commonly used for treating a wide range of infectious diseases in adults due to their broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and the availability of oral formulations. However, their use in children has been limited due to concerns about potential joint toxicity. Recently, fluoroquinolones have gained renewed interest for pediatric use, as new agents with a wider spectrum of activity and minimal toxicity are emerging.

Objectives:
This review explores the pharmacokinetics, clinical indications, and possible toxicity and safety profiles of fluoroquinolones in children.

Methods:
A MEDLINE search was conducted for systematic reviews and original research on:

Fluoroquinolone use in adults, children, and animals.

Clinical trials in adults.

Pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety in children.
The search yielded 23 relevant articles, including reviews, clinical trials, and original research.

Conclusion:
Fluoroquinolones should be considered when other antibiotic therapies fail or cannot be tolerated, as their benefits may outweigh concerns about safety and antimicrobial resistance.

Introduction
Nalidixic acid, developed in the 1960s, was the first quinolone used for treating urinary tract infections. Over the years, fluoroquinolones have been developed with improved antimicrobial, pharmacokinetic, and therapeutic properties. Early fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin) have activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. However, concerns about potential cartilage damage in animal models led to restrictions on their use in children. Despite this, fluoroquinolones have been used in pediatric cases where the potential benefit outweighed the risks, such as in cases of cystic fibrosis, chronic otitis media, complicated urinary tract infections, and resistant infections.

Mechanism and Spectrum of Activity
Fluoroquinolones are bactericidal agents that work by inhibiting the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, which is essential for DNA replication. They exhibit a broad antibacterial spectrum, being effective against many gram-negative organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella), and gram-positive organisms (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Some newer fluoroquinolones also target anaerobes and enterococci.

Pharmacokinetics
Fluoroquinolones are well absorbed orally, with excellent tissue penetration and long half-lives. However, pharmacokinetic data in children are limited due to their restricted use. For example, a study of ciprofloxacin in children found a peak concentration of 3.3 mg/L in infants and 2.1 mg/L in children. The drug has a shorter elimination half-life in children compared to adults, which may necessitate more frequent dosing in younger patients.

Clinical Usefulness and Advantages
Fluoroquinolones, despite their initial limitations, are increasingly used in children for specific conditions, such as multidrug-resistant infections, pulmonary diseases like cystic fibrosis, and osteomyelitis. Studies have shown that some fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, do not induce the cartilage toxicity seen in animal studies, making them a viable option for pediatric therapy under certain circumstances.
