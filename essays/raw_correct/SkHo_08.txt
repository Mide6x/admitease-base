Practical Love in the Home (III)

Dear Reader,

Last week, I discussed practical ways in which wives can demonstrate their love for their husbands. We explored the concept of God's unconditional and expressive love and how we are called to love our spouses and family members regardless of their actions or imperfections. We also established that loving your spouse is a commandment, not a choice, and that love must be actively expressed.

This week, I will present additional practical methods for showing love within the home. Love can be manifested through thoughts, words, and actions.

Expressing Love through Thoughts

Love originates in the heart and is conveyed through speech and actions. Husbands should cultivate love for their wives starting from their thoughts. As stated in Matthew 12:34, words reflect the contents of the heart. Therefore, a man's words towards his wife reveal his innermost feelings. Initiating love within the marriage sets a positive tone and fosters mutual affection and respect.

Expressing Love through Words

The phrase "I love you" may consist of only three words, yet it holds immense significance in solidifying the divine bond between a man and a woman. Unfortunately, these words often fade after the excitement of the wedding ceremony. Consistently reaffirming love through verbal expressions enriches the marital relationship. Just as rain is vital for a fruitful harvest, regularly saying "I love you" nurtures love and intimacy.

Continuously vocalizing affection reinforces the foundation of the relationship. It is essential to communicate feelings openly, as emphasized in Romans 10:10. Expressing love through words, filled with faith and sincerity, can transform even the most challenging situations. Kind and appreciative words create a harmonious atmosphere in the home and strengthen the marital bond.

Avoid incessant criticism and negativity towards your spouse. Constructive feedback should be delivered tactfully, following the sandwich method - praise, address the issue, and conclude with affirmation. Sustain the flame of love in your marriage; love serves as a healing balm. Invite God's love into your home to overcome obstacles and foster peace, progress, stability, and success.

In the upcoming discussion, we will explore demonstrating love through actions. If you have not embraced Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you may find it challenging to exhibit God's love. Accepting Jesus allows the love of God to dwell within you (Romans 5:5). Salvation involves confessing your sins and acknowledging Jesus as your Redeemer. If you desire salvation, you can pray: "Dear Lord, I acknowledge my sins and ask for Your forgiveness. Cleanse me with Your grace and become my Lord and Savior. I am now reborn in You!"

Sincerely,
