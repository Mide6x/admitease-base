National Policy on Scholarships and Loans

Federal Government policies on student financing for higher education programmes, both in the country and abroad, aim to make higher education more accessible to qualified Nigerian students, particularly the indigent and those in difficult circumstances.

The National Policy on Education (1981) states that "financial consideration alone will not be the conclusive barrier to higher education for anyone who can benefit from it. A combination of scholarships and loans will continue to be used to assist indigent but bright students in gaining access to higher education."

Historical Background

In Nigeria, student financing for higher education can be traced back to the introduction of western education by the missionaries. In the 19th century, education was financed through church donations and contributions from philanthropic organizations and individuals. The colonial administration later contributed through grants, and with the passing of the education law—the 1882 Education Ordinance—government financial involvement began.

As early as the 19th century, young Nigerians were sponsored for higher education abroad, to Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and the United Kingdom. By the early 20th century, education was financed by regional governments through aids. The private sector also contributed to education through fees and donations from missions and individual donors.

After independence, student financing by the three regional governments—Northern, Eastern, and Western—was vigorously pursued. They financed students' higher education in Nigerian universities and in institutions in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. This was prompted by the need to provide high-level manpower for the operation of the independent Nigerian state. The economic boom from oil in the early 1970s further facilitated financing for students. In fact, the Nigerian Students' Loans Board was established by Decree 25 of 1972 and reconstituted by Decree 12 of 1988, primarily to assist students in financing their education through loans.

However, by the early 1980s, the fortunes of student financing began to decline, primarily due to dwindling financial resources caused by an economic recession from falling oil prices, reduced production by OPEC, political instability, excessive spending in other sectors at the expense of education, and the growth of higher institutions coupled with the free-education policy during the 1979-83 civilian democratic regime.

The decade between 1980 and 1990 saw a general decline in student financing. Federal Government-sponsored overseas scholarships were suspended in 1985, and awards under the Bureau for External Aid (BEA), tenable in Eastern European countries, were also suspended due to the break-up of the Russian Federation. Scholarship awards for Nigerian higher institutions were reduced to only 1,000 postgraduate awards, and even then, the payment of allowances was consistently delayed.

In 1993, efforts to revamp student financing were made through the establishment of the Nigerian Education Bank by Decree 50 of 1997. The bank was intended to provide financial assistance to students in the country's institutions of higher learning and to institutions and individuals in both the public and private sectors participating in education. However, due to insufficient finances, administrative bottlenecks, and low loan repayment returns, the Nigerian Education Bank could not take off effectively. With its closure, the student loan scheme was also suspended, narrowing the opportunities for student assistance towards education.

Revitalization of Federal Government Scholarship Schemes

Education, particularly higher education, is widely regarded as a capital-intensive social service, even in more developed nations. Nigeria, facing increasing enrollment in universities and colleges, is constrained by a shortage of funds, insufficient management structures, inconsistent higher education policies, loss of highly skilled manpower to more developed countries, lack of coordination between government and non-governmental or private sector contributions, the burden of civil strife, natural disasters, and unsustainable foreign debts. As the primary source of student financing in Nigeria, the government has historically faced challenges in influencing student financing programmes effectively.

However, by the close of the 20th century, student financing in Nigeria experienced a significant boost with the coming to power of the current elected democratic civilian government under President Olusegun Obasanjo (GCFR). Funds allocated for revamping scholarship programmes were released, and the Federal Scholarship Board is now, more than ever, able to process awards both in Nigeria and abroad. It is poised to aggressively pursue proactive student financing programmes to benefit the numerous qualified Nigerian students.

Despite this, more avenues for sourcing funds need to be explored to meet the growing demand for financial assistance from the many qualified students desiring to further their education. Ongoing scholarship programmes that have been oversubscribed illustrate this. For awards tenable in Nigerian tertiary institutions, a total of 39,574 candidates were interviewed between November 19 and December 7, 2001, of which only about 15,000 (i.e., 37.9%) would be awarded scholarships for the first phase of the 50,000 awards for the 2001/2002 academic year.

For the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP) award, 1,418 qualified candidates with First Class and Second Class Upper degrees were shortlisted for interview for postgraduate courses abroad. However, only 53 (i.e., 3.7%) were nominated to six Commonwealth member nations.

Largely, the three tiers of government (Federal, State, and Local) sponsor student financing in Nigeria through the award of scholarships and bursaries by their respective agencies. At the federal level, the Federal Scholarship Board formulates policies on student financing, implements various scholarship programmes, and coordinates the policies and programmes of state scholarship boards to guide and streamline scholarship programmes nationwide.

Objectives of the Federal Government Scholarship Scheme

The main objectives of the Federal Government Scholarship Award Scheme include:

(i) To make higher education more accessible to less privileged but brilliant students who would not have been able to afford such education.

(ii) To supplement normal education and manpower development to meet high-level manpower needs.

(iii) To reward, promote, and encourage academic achievement and excellence.

(iv) To enhance persistence or retention in schools.

(v) To balance educational opportunities.

(vi) To promote the attainment of educational and national goals.

Ongoing Federal Government Scholarship Programmes

The Federal Government Scholarship programmes that are fully operational and well-funded by the current democratic civilian government include:

Scholarship Awards Tenable in Nigerian Tertiary Institutions
These awards include postgraduate and undergraduate awards in federal and state universities, awards for Higher National Diploma (HND) in federal and state polytechnics, and awards for Nigerian Certificate in Education (NCE) in federal and state colleges of education. As a result of the revitalization of Federal Government Scholarship programmes, 50,000 awards are being processed for the 2001/2002 academic year for students in these institutions. The first phase of the award will be implemented in April 2002, while the second phase will be completed before the end of the academic year.

However, it is necessary to note that these awards are for students in their second year of study and above who have scored a minimum of a 3.00 Cumulative Grade Point Aggregate (CGPA) in the previous academic year’s examination. To continue receiving the award, the scholar must maintain a 3.00 CGPA. Students in difficult circumstances (e.g., the handicapped) are automatically granted scholarships after participating in the award process.

Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP)
Nigeria's participation in the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP) began after independence in 1960, by virtue of its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations. Since then, Nigeria has been involved in the CSFP as both a receiving and awarding country. Nigeria continues to support the principles of the CSFP, which include strengthening the Commonwealth, promoting intellectual and professional achievement, supporting national development, and encouraging scholar mobility.

Since inception, Nigeria has received over 1,000 awards from other Commonwealth nations, with the highest number of awards coming from the United Kingdom and Canada. Nigeria has also granted over 180 awards. Nigeria is currently processing 30 awards to various member nations for the 2002/2003 academic year. Additionally, plans are underway to provide more scholarships to Sierra Leonean students for studies in Nigeria.

To maximize benefits from the CSFP, the Federal Government of Nigeria is considering full involvement in the activities and programmes of the CSFP, reciprocating awards regularly, and exploring the use of Distance Learning in future CSFP activities. Additionally, Nigerian universities are encouraged to participate fully in the programme by making reciprocal awards.
