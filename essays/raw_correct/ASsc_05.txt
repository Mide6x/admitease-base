National Policy on Scholarships and Loans

The Federal Government's policies on student financing for higher education programs, both within the country and abroad, aim to enhance accessibility to higher education for qualified Nigerian students, particularly those facing financial challenges.

The National Policy on Education (1981) stipulates that "financial constraints alone should not hinder access to higher education for individuals who can benefit from it. A combination of scholarships and loans will be utilized to support financially disadvantaged but academically bright students in pursuing higher education."

Historical Background

The financing of higher education for students in Nigeria can be traced back to the introduction of Western education by missionaries. In the 19th century, education was funded through church donations, contributions from philanthropic organizations, and individuals. The colonial administration later provided grants, and the '1882 Education Ordinance' marked the commencement of government financial involvement in education.

In the 19th century, young Nigerians were sponsored for higher education abroad in places like Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana), and the United Kingdom. By the early 20th century, regional governments started providing aid for students and education. The private sector also contributed to education through fees and donations from missions and individuals.

After independence, the three regional governments—Northern, Eastern, and Western—actively financed students for higher education in Nigerian universities, as well as institutions in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The establishment of the Nigerian Students' Loans Board by Decree 25 of 1972, later reconstituted by Decree 12 of 1988, aimed to assist students in funding their education through loans.

However, student financing faced challenges in the early 1980s due to dwindling financial resources resulting from economic recession, reduced oil prices, lower production levels by OPEC, political instability, over-expenditure in other sectors at the expense of education, and the proliferation of higher institutions alongside the free-education policy during the 1979-83 civilian government.

Efforts were made in 1993 to revitalize student financing with the establishment of the Nigerian Education Bank by Decree 50 of 1997. However, the bank faced challenges such as insufficient funding, administrative bottlenecks, and low loan repayment rates by student beneficiaries, leading to its ineffectiveness. Consequently, the student loan scheme was suspended, limiting opportunities for student financial assistance.

Revitalization of Federal Government Scholarship Schemes

Education, especially at the higher level, is considered a costly and resource-intensive social service even in developed nations. Nigeria, grappling with increased university enrollments, faces financial constraints, inadequate management structures, policy inconsistencies in higher education, brain drain to developed countries, lack of coordination between governmental and non-governmental organizations, civil unrest, natural disasters, and unsustainable foreign debts.

The late 20th century saw a surge in student financing in Nigeria following the election of the democratic civilian government under President Olusegun Obasanjo (GCFR). The government allocated funds to revamp scholarship programs, enabling the Federal Scholarship Board to enhance scholarship awards within and outside the country, with a focus on proactive student financing for eligible Nigerian students.

Despite these efforts, additional funding sources are necessary to meet the rising demand for financial aid among numerous qualified students seeking higher education. The oversubscription of ongoing scholarship programs underscores this need.

Federal Government Scholarship Objectives

The key objectives of the Federal Government Scholarship Award Scheme are to:

1. Increase access to higher education for deserving but financially disadvantaged students.
2. Contribute to educational and manpower development for high-level manpower requirements.
3. Recognize, promote, and incentivize academic excellence.
4. Improve student retention in educational institutions.
5. Ensure equal educational opportunities.
6. Support the achievement of educational and national objectives.

Ongoing Federal Government Scholarship Programs

The operational and well-funded Federal Government Scholarship programs include:

1. Scholarships for Nigerian Tertiary Institutions: Supporting postgraduate and undergraduate students in federal and state universities, HND awards in federal and state polytechnics, and NCE awards in federal and state colleges of education.
2. Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP): Nigeria's participation in the CSFP aims to strengthen the Commonwealth, promote academic excellence, support national development needs, facilitate international mobility of scholars, enhance higher educational institutions, encourage international development, foster international friendships, and provide study opportunities in host countries.

To maximize the benefits of the CSFP, Nigeria should consider full involvement in CSFP activities, reciprocating awards to member nations, exploring Distance Learning possibilities, encouraging Nigerian universities to participate fully in the program, diversifying award schemes, and engaging private sector organizations, foundations, and individuals in CSFP initiatives.
