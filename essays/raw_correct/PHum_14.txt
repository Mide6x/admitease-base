Celebrating African Culture

The recent Udiroko festival in Ado Ekiti was a vibrant showcase of culture and tradition. This annual cultural event serves as a platform for community members to come together in anticipation. Individuals from both near and far eagerly participate in this longstanding festival.

Udiroko Day symbolizes the commencement of a new year, prompting reflection on past accomplishments and setting goals for the upcoming year.

Staying true to tradition, this year's festivities commenced with the "Ijoko Awon Agba" (gathering of elders), recognizing the esteemed role of elders within the community. Additional activities leading up to the grand finale included Ewi's Football and Quiz Competition for the youth, as well as the Prince and Princess Night and Cocktail Party, sponsored by MTN.

The culminating event, hosted at the palace of the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, garnered a significant turnout. Olaolu Osundina, Regional Marketing Manager for MTN South West, highlighted MTN's commitment to supporting the festival, aiming to uphold the brand's 'Can do' ethos.

Osundina emphasized that MTN's backing of the festival serves to promote and showcase the richness of African culture on a global scale. He stated that the company leverages the festival to enhance brand affinity, encourage community engagement, and empower the local populace.

Expressing MTN's fervor for preserving African culture, Osundina affirmed, "We are deeply connected to our Nigerian and African heritage, and MTN takes pride in fostering these celebrations."
