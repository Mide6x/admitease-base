Tiv Traditional Marriage Songs

Despite the challenges faced by oral literature due to the influence of global culture, Tiv Oral Poetry continues to adapt and remains relevant in modern society. While modern, Christian-style weddings are becoming more popular, traditional Tiv marriage customs and the songs associated with them are still celebrated. This paper examines traditional bridal songs performed by women, using a functionalist approach to explore their roles. These songs serve various purposes: welcoming the bride to her new home, offering advice to the couple about their new roles and relationships with in-laws, and expressing the wife’s views on marriage. The songs are essentially a dialogue about marriage from different perspectives within Tiv society, highlighting the ongoing importance of Tiv Traditional Marriage Songs.

Introduction
Marriage is a significant rite of passage, often accompanied by numerous songs, as Ruth Finnegan notes in her study of oral traditions. She observes that there are songs for various life events such as birth, puberty, marriage, and funerals (Finnegan 242). Tiv marriage is no exception and has inspired a wealth of songs that vary depending on the type of marriage being celebrated. Over time, due to colonial influences and the introduction of Western culture, some types of marriage have faded while new forms have emerged. Akawe Torkula identifies five types of marriage among the Tiv: Yamshe (Exchange marriage), kwase keinen (Bride price marriage), iye (Pact marriage), kwase yamen (Marriage by purchase), and ivese i sha igyosugh (Marriage by force) (18). Despite the changes, marriage remains a highly revered institution, celebrated with joy and festivity.

The extent of the celebrations often depends on the wealth and status of the groom’s family. Once the traditional rites are completed, the bride is handed over to her new family, which organizes a reception for her. Only after this ceremony, where the bride is fully accepted, can she assume her role as a wife in the family or clan. As Gbatoun Fabian notes, any marriage that does not include a feast is considered mere cohabitation. Even marriages contracted by force, such as kwase yamen or ivese-i-sha-igyosugh, were celebrated as they symbolized either physical strength or financial prowess. The type of marriage also influenced the nature of the songs performed to honor the bride. For example, a woman seized in marriage was still celebrated, albeit in a way that could provoke tension or conflict, especially if the captured woman’s family retaliated.

The arrival of the bride is heralded by the Angwe, a public announcement, which marks the beginning of the festivities. This is followed by the formal tsautu or performance organized by men. However, this paper focuses on the impromptu performances by women. These songs serve multiple purposes, including announcing the marriage, praising the bride, offering advice, and highlighting both the bride's and the groom’s family's reactions to the marriage.

The Marriage Songs
The Tiv marriage songs can be classified into the following categories:

Announcement Songs: These songs alert the community to the event, signaling the arrival of the bride and marking the beginning of the celebration.

Angwe is the first announcement made by a solo performer, followed by the crowd repeating the phrase to spread the news.

Praise Songs: These songs celebrate the bride, often focusing on her physical appearance or character, indirectly praising the groom for his choice. One such song, which highlights the bride's walk and other physical traits, serves as an erotic appreciation of her, reflecting the close relationship between the bride and her family’s reputation.

Advisory Songs: These songs offer advice to the bride and groom on their new roles. For instance, one song advises the bride on how to treat her husband by providing food and taking care of him, while another warns both spouses to avoid negative behaviors like gossiping or cheating.

Songs Expressing the Bride’s Feelings and Fears: These songs provide a glimpse into the bride’s emotional state, often revealing anxieties about her new life and relationships.

Reactions from the Groom’s Family: These songs highlight the reactions of the groom’s family to their new daughter-in-law, welcoming her into the family with warmth and laughter.

As demonstrated by these various song forms, Tiv Traditional Marriage Songs continue to play an essential role in the celebration and social integration of a bride, and they offer valuable insights into the cultural values surrounding marriage in Tiv society.
