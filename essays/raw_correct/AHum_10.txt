Tiv Traditional Marriage Songs

Despite the diminishing influence of oral literature, particularly in the face of global culture, Tiv Oral Poetry is persistently adapting to meet the current societal needs. While modern Christian weddings appear to be thriving, traditional marriage and the accompanying song-poetry still maintain their significance. This paper utilizes a functionalist approach to investigate the traditional bridal songs performed by women. These songs serve various functions, such as welcoming the bride to her new home, providing advice to the couple regarding their new roles and relationships with their in-laws. Additionally, some of these songs express the wife's perspective on marriage. Therefore, the song form serves as a dialogue on marriage from all segments of Tiv society, showcasing the ongoing relevance of "Tiv Traditional Marriage Songs."

Introduction

Marriage, being one of many rites of passage, has inspired a wealth of poetry. As Ruth Finnegan notes, "rites of passage are very common occasions for singing. There are songs associated with birth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, acquiring a new title or status, and funeral celebrations" (Finnegan 242).

Similar to Finnegan's studies, Tiv marriage has generated a vast array of songs, varying based on the different types of marriages practiced in Tivland during the pre-colonial era. With colonial influence and the introduction of Western civilization, some marriage practices vanished, while new ones emerged. Nonetheless, Akawe Torkula identifies five distinct types of marriage among the Tiv: "Yamshe (Exchange marriage), kwase keinen (marriage by Dowry), iye (marriage by pact), kwase yamen (marriage by purchase), and ivese i sha igyosugh (marriage by force)" (18). Regardless of the type of marriage contracted, the institution was and still is highly esteemed and celebrated with pomp. Presently, marriages favoring kinship, such as kwase keinen and iye, are preferred among the Tiv people. Marriage continues to foster relationships among individuals in Tiv society, making it a widely celebrated institution.

The grandeur and festivity of a particular marriage are determined by the affluence and status of the groom's family. Once the traditional marriage rites are completed, the bride is handed over to her new family, which must host a reception for her. Only after a woman is 'kuhwa' does she formally assume her rightful place among the wives in the family or clan. According to Gbatoun Fabian, a marriage without a feast is viewed as mere cohabitation.

Even marriages initiated by force or purchase, like kwase yamen or ivese i sha igyosugh, are celebrated. Moreover, to the groom's family, a marriage initiated by force or purchase signifies physical strength or financial capability. The type of marriage contracted determines the nature of the songs performed to honor the bride. Iyortom recounts a scenario where a man's wife was forcefully taken by young troublemakers, emphasizing that even a captured wife was celebrated, regardless of her feelings. Such instances often led to tensions and, in extreme cases, conflicts, especially if the husband's lineage or clan felt dishonored.

Due to its potential for discord and the advent of colonialism, the concept of "honorable marriage by capture: the iye" was introduced (Sai, Akiga's Story, 41). Similarly, Wegh's depiction of this marriage practice, albeit brief, sheds light on its process. The iye system was interconnected with yamshe, where a successful iye outing resulted in a man returning with multiple wives. In some cases, the girls did not elope immediately, and compensation was provided to their parents later.

Marriage in Tivland is accompanied by extensive singing and dancing, with a specific song form called "ger-kwase" or "kwase kuhwan" associated with it, denoting the feast or dance accompanying the ceremony. The bride's arrival is heralded by the "Angwe," signifying the recognition of an esteemed member of the clan or family. This impromptu celebration involves family, friends, and well-wishers. However, the official "tsautu," a more formal welcoming organized by men, occurs on a later date. This paper focuses on the spontaneous performances by women rather than the formal occasion.

The Marriage Songs

The songs of the "kwase kuhwan" dance, performed when the bride is brought home by her husband and his companions in cases of elopement, or by the girl's friends and family in formal marriages, are categorized as follows:

(a) Songs that announce the event to the public,
(b) Songs that praise the bride,
(c) Songs that offer advice to the couple,
(d) Songs that highlight the bride's emotions and concerns about marriage, and
(e) Songs that depict the reaction of the groom's family to their son's wife.

(A) These songs, starting with the "Angwe," inform people about the significant event. As the couple approaches the village outskirts in the evening, ululations are heard, awakening even those asleep to listen. The Angwe announcer, preceding the party with the bride, proclaims the news, serving as the Tiv traditional method of mass communication regarding marriages.

The subsequent song performed by Ruth Mtemave calls attention to the presence of the bride and the ongoing celebration.

This song urges people, especially those participating in kwase kuhwan, to wake up. Similar to the Angwe announcing the bride's arrival, this song prompts everyone, including those asleep, to welcome the bride. The solo part is repeated in the chorus, making it an antiphonal song like many others. Another antiphonal song welcomes the bride.

This song, sung by a child eager for the bride's arrival to enjoy goat meat, lacks the maturity of the previous one. Reflecting the persona's excitement for the upcoming feast, the song signifies the anticipation of the special occasion. Although initially composed by a child, women now perform these songs, imitating the childlike voice of the persona. The next two songs welcome the bride and wish her a pleasant stay with her new family. While these songs are unnamed, the first lines are used as references, serving as titles when written down.

In these songs, the bride is introduced to her new family, starting with her parents-in-law. Each family member welcomes her with laughter to put her at ease. The song may extend based on the number of family members present for the introduction. The newcomer is encouraged to rest well, signifying African hospitality as the family strives to make her comfortable in her new environment.

The subsequent songs praise the bride while indirectly applauding the groom's choice of a wife.

Although challenging to render, the translation provided is an interpretation of the song. The poet, likely a member of the groom's family, describes the wife in sensual terms, appreciating her seductive gait and lush pubic hair. The intimate portrayal of the bride may stem from her physical attributes or the investigations conducted before the marriage, as was customary in pre-colonial times. These short songs, often performed at impromptu marriage celebrations, are popular in Tivland due to their simplicity and memorability.

Other songs educate the bride on her husband's habits, extending beyond mere instruction to caution both spouses to adopt suitable behaviors fitting their new roles. For instance, the next song likens an unmarried man to a beggar who is always well-fed from various sources, advising the bride to provide food promptly to her husband. It also warns the husband against cooking for himself, as that would encroach on the wife's role. This underscores the strict adherence to gender roles in Tiv culture, where a married man cooking for himself would face societal disapproval. The song's structure involves repeating the names of various bachelors in the neighborhood, adding length to the piece.

Another song advises the bride to focus on her marriage, emphasizing her responsibility to care for her husband's needs. Diligence in fulfilling her marital duties, alongside procreation, is highlighted. The song cautions against vices such as theft, gossip, witchcraft, adultery, and jealousy.
