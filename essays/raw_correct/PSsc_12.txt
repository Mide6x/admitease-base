Inside the community of physically challenged individuals,
Millions of Nigerian citizens with various forms of disabilities are living in extremely challenging conditions every day as they struggle to survive, as reported by Sunday Oguntola with additional contributions by Joe Agbro Jr.

For two arduous years, Timothy Oni searched tirelessly across Lagos metropolis for accommodation, but to no avail. Despite having sufficient funds to pay any amount, he faced rejection from landlords due to his blindness. He recounted, "I tried everything possible to find a place to call home." After two frustrating years, he finally secured accommodation in a Lagos suburb. However, the process had left him emotionally drained, unable to even celebrate what he considered "a significant miracle."

Dare Dairo, a qualified TV producer, applied for a job at a broadcasting station. Despite excelling in the recruitment process, he was denied the job by the executive producer due to his physical disability. Dairo, who limps, was devastated by the discrimination he faced. He expressed, "It was a dream job, and I was prepared to give my best. Being rejected not based on competence but because of my disability was disheartening."

Stella Emekaâ€™s experience at a bank in Agege, Lagos, highlighted the challenges individuals with disabilities face in accessing basic services. She was denied entry due to the bank's security door not accommodating her crutches. Following a public scene, she was eventually attended to outside the banking hall. Emeka's encounter led her to develop a strong aversion towards banking activities.

Oni, Dairo, and Emeka represent a significant portion of the 14 million Nigerians living with disabilities, as reported by the World Bank. These individuals face various challenges, with stigma and discrimination being the most pervasive. They are often viewed as strange or cursed, leading to widespread discrimination and exclusion in society.

Victoria Akanji, an amputee, expressed the prevailing attitude towards persons with disabilities, stating, "Nigerians see us as dispensable beings on the way to hell, considering us worthless and unable to achieve anything in life." This negative perception exacerbates the stigma and discrimination faced by individuals with disabilities, denying them opportunities for economic empowerment and societal integration.

David Anyaele, executive director of Citizens with Disabilities (CCD), emphasized the need for empathy and support rather than pity or handouts towards persons with disabilities. He stressed the importance of recognizing their full humanity and providing equal opportunities for their participation in society.

The lack of accessibility in public infrastructure further complicates the lives of persons with disabilities in Nigeria. Many public buildings and transportation systems are not designed to accommodate their needs, limiting their mobility and access to essential services.

Aliyu Amusu, a Para-Olympic athlete with a physical disability, shared his story of resilience despite facing challenges. While highlighting the limitations in infrastructure and societal attitudes, he emphasized the importance of recognizing and supporting individuals with disabilities to lead fulfilling lives.

The absence of government policies addressing disability issues in Nigeria reflects a critical gap in supporting persons with disabilities. Experts underscore the need for comprehensive policies and interventions to ensure the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with disabilities in all aspects of society.

As Nigerians await government action, there is a call for empathy, understanding, and support towards persons with disabilities. Providing opportunities for their participation and access to inclusive infrastructure is crucial for enhancing their quality of life and promoting their contributions to society.
