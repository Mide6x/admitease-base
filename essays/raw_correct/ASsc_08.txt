DETERMINANTS OF FOOD CHOICES OF ADOLESCENTS IN SOUTH-WESTERN NIGERIA

ABSTRACT

Food choices among adolescents have become increasingly unhealthy, placing them at greater risk of malnutrition as they grow older. This study investigates the determinants of food choices in adolescents to assess their nutritional knowledge and its implications. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), children aged 10-19 years are classified as adolescents. Four hundred and one adolescents in secondary schools were interviewed across six of the thirty local government areas in Osun State, a southwestern state in Nigeria. Based on the population of secondary schools in these local government areas, thirty-two schools were selected. Pre-tested structured questionnaires, featuring high-quality color photographs of foods and drinks typically offered to adolescents, were used. The photographs depicted various foods such as biscuits, buns, and meat pies (classified as "snacks") and meals like rice and beans with vegetables and fish or meat stew, stewed beans, and pounded yam (representing conventional meals). Similarly, photographs of drinks like coke, milk, chocolate drinks, and homemade non-alcoholic beverages were also presented to the adolescents. The information was collected using these visuals. Descriptive statistical techniques, such as frequency counts, percentages, means, and standard deviations, as well as inferential tools such as correlation analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were applied to the data. The study found a positive and significant correlation between the preference and nutritional contents of foods (r = 0.514, p<0.05) and drinks (r = 0.346, p<0.05). There was no significant difference in the preference and perceived nutritional contents of foods (F = 3.072), while there was a difference in the choice and perceived nutritional contents of drinks (F = 0.217) between urban and rural adolescents. The study concluded that food choices among adolescents in the study area were more influenced by taste preferences than by nutritional content. Although adolescents displayed high nutritional knowledge, their awareness of homemade non-alcoholic drinks was limited. Nutrition education, particularly on traditional foods and nutritious homemade drinks, should be intensified.

INTRODUCTION

The nutritional quality of diets among adolescent school children in Nigeria has raised concerns. The issue of helping adolescents choose foods that contribute to a nutritionally balanced meal remains unresolved. Several studies have examined the food habits and preferences of adolescents, particularly at school meals. These studies indicate a strong preference for snack foods such as cakes, biscuits, crisps, and fizzy drinks. Additionally, they report that, in most cases, adolescents possess fairly sound nutritional knowledge. Some studies have also noted that the healthiness of meals is not a significant factor in adolescents' food choices. Instead, personal preferences for taste, texture, and appearance have a greater influence than the perceived nutritional value of foods. A number of authors have emphasized the need for school-based initiatives to improve children's eating habits, while others stress that these efforts should consider adolescents' beliefs about food. Some studies have observed an inverse relationship between the perceived healthiness of foods and adolescents' preferences. Despite this, the difference in nutritional value between healthy and favorite foods was not as substantial as nutritionists might have feared. Meals chosen based on preference were often just as healthy as those chosen based on perceptions of healthiness.

While previous studies have explored general food preferences and choices at school, few have investigated the factors influencing adolescents' food choices, their nutritional knowledge, and attitudes towards food and health. This paper aims to address these gaps by focusing on the foods and drinks commonly served at home, those most frequently chosen by adolescents, and their perceptions of the healthiness of these choices.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the factors that influence food and drink choices among adolescents in south-western Nigeria. Two hypotheses were tested in the study:

There is no significant relationship between the choice of foods and drinks and their nutritional content among adolescents.

There is no variation in food and drink choices between urban and rural adolescents.

METHODS

Osun State, with a land area of 925,100 hectares (9,251 kmÂ²) and an estimated population of 2,184,569 in 1998, is divided into 30 local government areas (LGAs), with urban and rural districts. During the study period (September to November 2004), 239,829 adolescents aged 10-19 years were attending government schools. The adolescents were the subjects of a cross-sectional study conducted in both urban and rural areas of the state, employing a multistage stratified random sampling technique. A list of government schools was obtained from the Department of Planning, Research, and Statistics, Ministry of Education, Oshogbo, Nigeria. Thirty-two schools were randomly selected, with 25 from urban areas and 7 from rural areas.

The final sample size was determined through the following steps: first, the number of adolescents in urban and rural areas was estimated at 80% and 20%, respectively, considering that some rural adolescents attend schools in urban areas. The number of students selected from each school was proportional to the total student population at the school. Lastly, classrooms were chosen by systematic sampling, and adolescents were selected randomly from each classroom. Available statistics indicate that Osun State has the highest number of schoolchildren in the country.

A structured questionnaire was used for data collection, administered to 450 adolescent students across various schools, with 401 included in the analysis (267 from urban areas and 134 from rural areas). Each interview lasted approximately 20 minutes and was conducted during lunch breaks to avoid disrupting lessons.

A set of high-quality color photographs of foods and drinks typically offered to adolescents at home was presented. These included biscuits, buns, meat pies (classified as "snacks") and meals such as rice, beans, and pounded yam. Additionally, drinks such as coke, milk, chocolate drinks, and homemade non-alcoholic beverages like 'kunu' (made from millet or guinea corn) and 'sobo' (made from Roselle Calyx) were also featured. Adolescents were not informed about the study's purpose and were asked to select foods and drinks they would most likely choose if offered these options. They were then asked to rate each item on a five-point scale from "very likely to choose" (5) to "very unlikely to choose" (1). Subsequently, they rated the healthiness of each item on a similar five-point scale, ranging from "very healthy" (5) to "very unhealthy" (1).

DATA ANALYSIS

For the meal selection task, the frequency with which foods were selected as the "preferred meal" and the "healthy meal" was determined, and comparisons were made between urban and rural adolescents. Mean values for the rating scores on both the preferred meals and healthy meals scales were calculated. Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between preferred meals/drinks and their perceived healthiness. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to differentiate food and drink choices between urban and rural adolescents. Statistical significance was tested at the 5% level (P<0.05).

RESULTS

FOODS AND DRINKS MOST LIKELY TO BE CHOSEN

The most frequently chosen food items were rice (boiled and stewed rice), followed by fresh fruits, bread, pounded yam, yam flour (amald), stewed beans, and bean pudding (moinmoin), each chosen by over 50% of both urban and rural adolescents. The least popular choices included boiled yam, yam porridge, bean balls, and cassava flour products (Gari and Fufu). Rural adolescents were significantly more likely than urban adolescents to choose stewed beans, while urban adolescents favored bean pudding (moinmoin), bean cake (akara), and snacks.

For drinks, fruit juice, milk drinks, water, and soft drinks were the most frequently chosen, each selected by over 70% of both urban and rural adolescents. The least popular drinks included chocolate drinks, 'sobo', and 'kunu'. Similar trends were observed for both urban and rural adolescents.

FOODS AND DRINKS PERCEIVED TO BE HEALTHY

Foods most frequently regarded as healthy included stewed beans, rice, fruits, and bread, all chosen by over 70% of adolescents in both urban and rural areas. Yam and cassava products followed closely behind. Snacks were perceived as the least healthy food choice. Similarly, the most commonly perceived healthy drinks were fruit juice, milk, and water, while 'kunu', 'sobo', and sweetened drinks were regarded as unhealthy. Despite their low perceived healthiness, a significant proportion of adolescents (76% for soft drinks and 47% for sweetened drinks) preferred these beverages, likely due to their affordability and availability, despite the potential health risks.
