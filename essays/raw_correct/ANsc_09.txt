Organic Waste Reclamation, Recycling, and Re-use in Integrated Fish Farming in the Niger Delta

ABSTRACT:
This paper aims to raise awareness about the significance of integrated fish farming in organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use. An example of integrated fish farming practiced at a micro-level in the Niger Delta of Nigeria is a crop-snailry-poultry (chicken)-livestock (pig)-cum-fish production system. In this system, fish production remains the most important activity. The organic wastes reclaimed, recycled, and re-used in this system include plant matter, chicken and pig excrements, snail, oyster, and periwinkle shells, ox blood and bone, fish waste, palm kernel cake, groundnut cake, pond silt, and the aquatic fern Azolla pinnata. Other reclaimable, recyclable, and reusable materials are also discussed. Integrating organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use in integrated fish farming, along with treatment, incineration, landfill, and composting, can help significantly reduce waste in both rural and urban areas.

Waste reclamation refers to the recovery of a waste component for use in a manner different from its initial function. Re-use involves multiple uses of a given material or product, while recycling is the recovery of materials from waste for reintroduction into the production cycle to reproduce the same item (Ademoroti, 1996). In integrated fish farming, many organic wastes are reclaimed, recycled, and re-used. This system has been proposed as an environmentally friendly way of recycling waste, especially from high trophic-level fish species that require the supply of exogenous energy (Buschmann, 2000). Reclamation, recycling, and re-use help address waste disposal issues and resource material scarcity. Integrated fish farming is a traditional practice and one of the developmental characteristics of aquaculture in China (Hu and Zhou, 1989). In many integration processes in Asia and other developing countries, fish production remains the primary activity, though commercial pig/chicken/duck production is also accompanied by fish and crop production, using animal waste as fish feed and manure for crops (Mukherjee, 1995). In this integrated ecosystem, crops are producers, livestock and fish are consumers, and aquatic and soil organisms are decomposers, forming a complete ecosystem (Yang and Hu, 1989). Aquaculture has recycled animal waste as fertilizer for centuries to boost pond productivity of plants and animals (Velasquez, 1980; Oladosu et al., 1990). Apart from fertilization, animal waste contains valuable protein, amino acids, and other nutrients, making it useful for processing into animal feed and feedstuffs (Nash et al., 1980).

The global agricultural waste generation is expected to rise significantly if developing countries continue intensifying their farming systems (UNEP, 1992). In some cities like Medellin, Colombia, salvaging secondary raw materials from waste dumps provides an important source of income and raw materials for local industry. Small-scale composting and biogas generation projects from household and agricultural waste have been set up in rural communities. These waste management approaches, though not widely spread or effectively organized, offer practical and cost-effective solutions to waste disposal issues in developing countries. Internationally, treatment, incineration, landfill, and composting are recognized as viable solutions for solid waste management. However, awareness of integrated fish farming as a means to address the organic waste challenges in the Niger Delta is limited. This paper, therefore, seeks to raise awareness of the importance of integrated fish farming in organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data for this study were collected through field observations, experimentation, literature reviews, and personal interviews conducted in three states in the Niger Delta: Bayelsa, Rivers, and Akwa Ibom.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Layout of Integrated Fish Farming Practiced at the Micro-Level in the Niger Delta
In the Niger Delta of Nigeria, a micro-level practice of integrated fish farming has been observed, featuring a crop-snailry-poultry (chicken)-livestock (pig)-cum-fish production system. In this system, fish production remains the most important activity. Crops cultivated in this system include pineapple (Ananas sp.), plantain (Musa sp.), pawpaw (Carica papaya), maize (Zea mays), pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis), and waterleaf (Talinum triangulare). The snails raised are Archachatina marginata and Achatina achatina. The poultry production includes egg-laying birds and various exotic broilers, while the livestock mainly consists of exotic and local pig breeds. The fish species cultured include fry, fingerlings, table-size fish, and broodstock of Clarias gariepinus (African catfish), Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Heterobranchus longifilis (mud catfish), hybrid catfish (Clarias x Heterobranchus), Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zilli, Heterotis niloticus, Ophiocephalus (Channa) (snakehead fish), and Gymnarchus niloticus.

The typical practice involves siting the crop unit, snailry, and pig breeding pens on a portion of land away from the fish ponds. Pigsties for the grow-out or fattening of pigs are constructed on pond dykes, while poultry houses are built over production ponds in a vertically integrated system.

Reclamation, Recycling, and Re-use of Organic Wastes in the Niger Delta
Currently, organic wastes reclaimed, recycled, and re-used at the micro-level in the Niger Delta include plant matter such as plantain leaves, ripe plantain, unripe and ripe pawpaw fruits and leaves, and wet chaff from fermented or milled maize. Other wastes include chicken and pig excrement; snail, oyster, and periwinkle shells; ox blood, ox bone, fish waste, brewers waste, palm kernel cake (a byproduct of oil processing), groundnut cake (a byproduct of groundnut oil processing), pond silt, and aquatic fern Azolla pinnata. The plant matter is used as feed for snails, while excrement from snails, chickens, and pigs serves as manure for crops like pumpkin and waterleaf.

Chicken and pig excrement are used both as food and manure in fish ponds, either in wet or dry form. In tropical fish farming, organic domestic or animal husbandry waste serves as both food and fertilizer. The microbial decomposition of chicken, pig, goat, and ox excreta enriches pond water with nutrients that help produce phytoplankton, zooplankton, and, ultimately, fish (Simoens, 1995). Due to poultry's short digestive tract, 80% of chicken manure consists of undigested feedstuff, containing 20-30% total protein (Pudadera et al., 1986). Thus, in the integrated poultry-fish farming system, species like Tilapia and African mudfish (stocked in polyculture) benefit from additional feed sources, including uneaten chicken feed and fresh droppings consumed directly by the fish species (Pudadera et al., 1986; Baras et al., 1982).

Processed poultry manure is also used to feed pigs, while pig manure is used to fertilize fish ponds (Chen, 1981). Additionally, pig manure can be composted using a pig-on-litter system, a dry system involving fermentation with sawdust and bacterial products to absorb, decompose, and stabilize pig waste, which can then be turned into pellets for fish and ruminant feeding (Mukherjee, 1995). Studies have shown that the growth of Tilapia is enhanced in polyculture with pig manure, as observed in Ansa and Jiyaâ€™s (2002) research.

Fish waste, including heads, bones, and guts, is chopped up and fed to pigs as a supplement. Fish farming benefits from various by-products such as frogs and macrophytes (Randriamiarana et al., 1985). Cow blood (a protein source) and bone meal (a calcium source) are used in fish and pig feed. Other organic waste materials used in the production of supplementary feeds include brewers waste, palm kernel cake, groundnut cake, toad meal, tadpole meal, crab meal, oyster, and snail shells (Ayinla et al., 1992; Idoniboye et al., 1993; Bekibele et al., 1995).

Pond silt serves as manure for crops, though excess amounts can negatively affect water quality. When used appropriately, pond silt improves soil structure, enhances nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium retention, and increases water retention capacity (Huazh and Baotong, 1989).

Periwinkle shells are repurposed for road construction, concrete making, and filling flooded grounds, while oyster shells are used in producing calcium carbide, lime, fertilizer, and cement. The ashes of these shells are used as abrasives for polishing metal wares (Ansa and Bashir, 2003).

Aquatic fern Azolla pinnata has been tested as feed for Oreochromis niloticus. Abioye et al. (1993) found improved growth performance when replacing up to 20% of conventional feed with Azolla meal. This fern can be used as feed for fish, chickens, ducks, pigs, and rabbits in various forms (fresh, dried, ensiled, or pelletized) (Van Hove and Ruelle, 1989).

Other Aspects of Organic Waste Reclamation, Recycling, and Re-use
Additional recyclable and reusable waste materials include household waste, scraps from slaughterhouses, feathers, cow manure, treated sewage, pig hairs, paper, and biogas waste materials. Fish can be fed with scraps from slaughterhouses, brewing drafts, household waste, rice bran, and other by-products. Feather meal is used in poultry feed, and cow manure is employed as both fish feed and fertilizer, a practice long used in China. Integrating fish and cow farming reduces the need for organic fertilizer for fish farming. Household waste materials, such as vegetable waste, can be used as feed for livestock, while biogas is produced from these organic waste materials.

Conclusion
The reclamation, recycling, and re-use of organic wastes in integrated fish farming in the Niger Delta are environmentally friendly practices that contribute significantly to waste reduction. This system, while not widely practiced, offers a sustainable solution for waste management in the region. It encourages resource conservation and promotes agricultural sustainability. Raising awareness of the benefits of integrated fish farming is crucial to enhance its practice across the Niger Delta and other regions facing similar challenges. Future studies should explore the potential for scaling up these practices and incorporating new technologies to improve waste management and productivity in integrated fish farming.
