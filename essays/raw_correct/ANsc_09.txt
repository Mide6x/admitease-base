Organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use in integrated fish farming in the Niger Delta

ABSTRACT: This paper aims to raise awareness of the importance of integrated fish farming in organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use. An example of integrated fish farming practiced at a micro-level in the Niger Delta of Nigeria involves crop-snail-poultry (chicken)-livestock (pig)-cum-fish production. Fish production remains the primary activity in this system. Organic wastes reclaimed, recycled, and re-used include plant matter, chicken and pig excrements, snail, oyster, and periwinkle shells, ox blood and bone, fish wastes, palm kernel cake, groundnut cake, pond silt, and aquatic fern Azolla pinnata. This paper also discusses other reclaimable, recyclable, and re-usable materials. Integrating organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use in integrated fish farming through treatment, incineration, landfill, and composting can significantly reduce waste in rural and urban areas.

Waste reclamation involves recovering a component of waste for use in a different manner, re-use refers to the multiple uses of a material or product, and recycling involves recovering the matter from waste to reproduce the same item (Ademoroti, 1996). Integrated fish farming utilizes many organic wastes that are reclaimed, recycled, and re-used, offering an environmentally friendly approach to recycling wastes, especially those from the production of high trophic level fish species that require external energy input (Buschmann, 2000). Reclamation, recycling, and re-use help address waste disposal issues and resource scarcity. Integrated fish farming, a traditional practice and a developmental characteristic of aquaculture in China (Hu and Zhou, 1989), emphasizes fish production as a key activity in many integration processes in Asia and other developing countries. Commercial pig/chicken/duck production is often accompanied by fish and crop production, utilizing animal waste as fish feed and crop manure (Mukherjee, 1995). This integrated ecosystem involves crops as producers, livestock and fish as consumers, and aquatic and soil organisms as decomposers, forming a complete ecosystem (Yang and Hu, 1989). Aquaculture has historically recycled animal waste as fertilizer to enhance pond productivity (Velasquez, 1980; Oladosu et al, 1990). Animal wastes, besides fertilization, can be processed into animal feed and feedstuffs due to their nutrient content (Nash et al, 1980).

The intensification of farming systems in developing countries is projected to lead to a significant increase in agricultural wastes worldwide (UNEP, 1992). Salvaging secondary raw materials from waste sites is a vital income source for some individuals in developing countries, while small-scale projects for composting and biogas generation from household and agricultural waste have been established in many rural communities. Although these waste management approaches are not widely implemented or well-organized, they offer practical and cost-effective solutions to waste disposal challenges in developing countries. Globally, there is growing recognition of treatment, incineration, landfill, and composting as methods to address solid waste issues. However, awareness of integrated fish farming as a means to combat organic household, industrial, and agricultural waste problems in the Niger Delta remains low. This paper aims to raise awareness of the role of integrated fish farming in organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected through field observation, experimentation, literature review, and personal interviews in three states in the Niger Delta: Bayelsa, Rivers, and Akwa Ibom.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Lay-out of integrated fish farming at the micro-level in the Niger Delta In the Niger Delta of Nigeria, integrated fish farming at the micro-level involves crop-snail-poultry (chicken)-livestock (pig)-cum-fish production. Fish production remains the primary activity in this system. The cultivated crops include pineapple (Ananas sp.), plantain (Musa sp.), pawpaw (Carica papaya), maize (Zea mays), pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis), and waterleaf (Talinum triangulare). Snails reared are Archachatina marginata and Achatina achatina. Poultry production includes egg-laying birds and various exotic broilers, while livestock consists of exotic and local pig breeds. Fish species include Clarias gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Heterobranchus longifilis, hybrid catfish (Clarias x Heterobranchus), Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zilli, Heterotis niloticus, Ophiocephalus (Channa), and Gymnarchus niloticus. The usual practice involves locating crop units, snailry, and pig breeding pens on a portion of land separate from the fish ponds. Pigsties for pig fattening are constructed on pond dykes, and poultry houses are built over production ponds in a vertically integrated system.

Reclamation, recycling, and re-use of organic wastes in the Niger Delta: Organic wastes currently reclaimed, recycled, and re-used at the micro-level in the Niger Delta include plant matter such as plantain leaves, ripe plantain, unripe and ripe fruit, and pawpaw leaves; wet chaff from fermented, milled, or ground maize. Other wastes include chicken and pig excrement, snail, oyster, and periwinkle shells, ox-blood, ox-bone, fish waste, brewers waste, palm kernel cake, groundnut cake, pond silt, and aquatic fern Azolla pinnata. Plant matter is used as feed for snails, while excrements/waste from snails, chickens, and pigs serve as crop manure for pumpkin and waterleaf. Chicken and pig excrements are utilized as food and manure in fish ponds, either in wet or dry form. In tropical fish farming, organic domestic or animal husbandry wastes function as both food and fertilizer. The microbial decomposition of various animal excreta enriches the water with nutrients that support the production of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and ultimately fish (Simoens, 1995). Chicken manure, due to the short digestive tract of poultry, contains undigested feed-stuff, with a high protein content (Chen, 1981). In an integrated poultry-fish farming system, both Tilapia and African mudfish benefit from additional feed sources, including uneaten chicken feed and fresh chicken droppings (Pudadera et al, 1986; Barash et al, 1982). Studies have shown improved performance of Clarias gariepinus in polyculture with Oreochromis niloticus under integrated poultry-cum-fish farming systems with supplemented feeding (Oladosu et al, 1990). Chicken manure is highly valued for vegetable farming in many countries and is commonly used in fish farms practicing polyculture in China, the Philippines, India, Israel, and other nations. Processed poultry manure can be utilized to feed pigs, and pig manure can fertilize fish ponds (Chen, 1981).

Chicken manure, pig manure, and brewers waste are used to produce housefly maggots, which serve as fish feed or in making supplementary fish feed. Pig manure can be employed in a pig-on-litter system, which involves in situ fermentation or composting using a bedding mixture to absorb, decompose, and stabilize the pig waste, producing dried mass for fish and ruminant feeding (Mukherjee, 1995). Research has shown that Tilapia can achieve significant growth under fish-cum-pig integration without additional supplementary feeds (Ansa and Jiya, 2002).

Fish wastes, such as heads, bones, and guts, are chopped up and fed as supplements to pigs. Pig breeding benefits from various by-products of fish farming, including frogs and macrophytes (Randriamiarana et al, 1985). Cow blood and bone meal are used for fish and pig supplementary feeds, along with other organic wastes like brewers waste, palm kernel cake, groundnut cake, toad meal, tadpole meal, crab meal, oyster shells, and snail shells (Ayinla et al, 1992; Idoniboye et al, 1993; Bekibele et al, 1995). Pond silt is utilized as crop manure, providing fertilizer benefits; however, an excess of silt can impact water quality negatively (Huazh and Baotong, 1989).

Periwinkle shells find applications in road construction, concrete making, and filling flooded grounds. Oyster shells are used in producing calcium carbides, lime, fertilizer, and cement. The ashes of shells are used by housewives as an abrasive for cleaning and polishing metal wares (Ansa and Bashir, 2003).

Aquatic fern Azolla pinnata has been tested as feed for Oreochromis niloticus, showing better growth performance in treatment containing Azolla pinnata meal. Azolla can be fed to various animals in fresh, dried, ensiled, or pellet form (Van Hove and Ruelle, 1989).

Other aspects of organic waste reclamation, recycling, and re-use include household waste, slaughterhouse scraps, feathers, cow manure, treated sewage, pig hairs, papers, and biogas waste materials. Fish can be fed with scraps from slaughterhouses, brewing drafts, household waste, rice bran, manioc, lima beans, or potatoes (Randriamiarana, 1995). Feather meal is used
