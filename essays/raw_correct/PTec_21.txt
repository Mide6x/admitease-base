Starcomms Introduces New Data Subscription Payment Options

Over the weekend, CDMA operator Starcomms announced the launch of a new initiative aimed at enhancing the convenience of data subscription renewals for its subscribers. The company unveiled three new payment options for renewing and paying for data connections. These options include online renewal using recharge cards, direct airtime debit via SMS, or payment through subscribers’ Interswitch debit/ATM cards. This new payment method is accessible to Starcomms subscribers utilizing either Izap or 1x internet services.

To utilize the online payment feature, subscribers are required to register on the Starcomms website by providing their preferred username and data device number. Once the registration process is complete, the subscriber will receive their username and password via email.

Starcomms stated that registered subscribers have the flexibility to pay using recharge cards or Interswitch debit/ATM cards. Additionally, subscribers can modify their data package plans without visiting outlets or contacting the call center. Upon completing the transaction, customers will receive a unique reference number and their services will be renewed or reactivated within minutes.

In addition to online payment, Starcomms data subscribers can renew their subscriptions by entering a code sent as an SMS from any Starcomms phone. Commenting on this initiative, Starcomms’ Chief Commercial Officer, Mr. Tushar Maheshwari, emphasized the company's commitment to prioritizing customer satisfaction. He stated, "Putting the customer first is a core philosophy that we adhere to, and our latest initiative is a testament to our dedication to aligning with customer needs."
