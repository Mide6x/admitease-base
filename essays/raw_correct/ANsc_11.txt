**Comparative Evaluation of EDTA, Pyridine, and Acetic Acid for the Assessment of Available Heavy Metals from Domestic and Industrial Sludges**

**Introduction**

The increasing production of sludges derived from the treatment of industrial and domestic wastewaters presents a significant environmental challenge due to their final disposal. Sludge is recognized as a valuable resource that can be recycled as fertilizer and soil improvement material because it contains organic compounds, macronutrients, micronutrients, nonessential trace elements, organic micropollutants, microorganisms, and eggs of parasitic organisms (Alloway and Jackson, 1991). The high content of organic matter and substantial N and P concentrations suggest its use as a fertilizer in agriculture or as a regenerator for soil. 

Although such applications may benefit the soil, concerns about potential environmental pollution hazards, such as odor, water pollution, veterinary hazards, and contamination by heavy metals, need to be considered (Sterritt and Lester, 1980; Alloway and Jackson, 1991; Perez-Cid, et al., 1996; Baveye, et al., 1999). In order to assess the potential environmental impact of materials contaminated with metals, determining the total metal contents is insufficient. The chemical forms (or species) of the metal in the sample matrix determine its mobilization capacity, bioavailability, and related ecotoxicity (Ure and Davidson, 1995; Gupta, et al., 1996). Sequential extraction methods (Tessier, et al., 1979; Quevauviller, et al., 1993; McGrath, 1996; Olajire, et al., 2003) and different leaching tests, especially batch single extractions (McGrath, 1996; Ure, 1996), are the most common methods for estimating metal mobility in soil and sediment samples.

Various techniques have been introduced to remediate metal-contaminated soils, one of which is separating metals from the soil using chelating agents to form soluble metal-chelate complexes. Chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), are the most commonly used chelators because of their strong ability to bind to different heavy metals (Norvell, 1991; Peters and Shem, 1992; Kim and Ong, 1998; Kim and Ong, 2000). EDTA and acetic acid single extractions were originally developed for soil and sludge analysis and have been widely applied in this context (Ure, 1996; Tack and Verloo, 1996). However, little or no studies have been conducted to compare the effectiveness of EDTA, acetic acid, and pyridine extraction for leaching Pb, Hg, Cd, and Zn from sludge samples.

We believe it would be useful and interesting to adopt this method to evaluate the potential mobility of heavy metals from sludge samples under complexing or acidification processes, particularly when sludges are disposed of in landfills. The aim of this study was to investigate the leaching of heavy metals (Pb, Hg, Cd, and Zn) from domestic and industrial sludges to assess their mobilizable content. Given that the leaching behavior of sludge may vary depending on the type of sludge sample, a secondary objective was to identify the similarities and/or differences in EDTA, pyridine, and acetic acid leaching behavior in domestic and industrial sludges, which can be classified as highly organic matter-containing and typically inorganic, respectively.

**Materials and Methods**

**Sampling**

The description of the sampling sites is shown in Table 1. The industrial sludge samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants of industries located at Ogba Industrial Estate, including Chemiron Pharmaceutical industry (site 4), Wamco Dairy Industry (site 5), and vegetable oil industries (site 6). Additional industrial sludge samples were obtained from Apapa Industrial Estate, including Flour Mills (site 7), Flour Mill Fertilizer section (site 8), and from Ijora Industrial area, which included Nitol Textile Industry (site 9). The domestic sludge samples were collected from various residential wastewater sources, including sites near scrap metal dumping (site 2) and a local oil factory (site 3) in Sabo, Ogbomoso. 

The samples were grouped according to their district and source: DS1 (site 1), DS2 (site 2), DS3 (site 3), IS1 (sites 4, 5, and 6), IS2 (sites 7 and 8), and IS3 (site 9). DS represents domestic sludges, and IS represents industrial sludges. All the sludge samples were collected by multiple sampling (approximately 2 kg) in polyethylene containers, dried in the laboratory at 105°C (Zufiaurre, et al., 1998) until a constant weight was achieved. The dried samples were ground in a mortar, sieved using a nylon fiber sieve, and thoroughly mixed and homogenized. The prepared samples were then bottled in polyethylene containers and stored in desiccators at laboratory temperature prior to analysis.

**Reagents**

All reagents used were of high-quality analytical reagent grade. The stock solutions of metals (1000 g/mL) were prepared by dissolving the appropriate salts of the metals in doubly distilled water. Concentrated nitric acid (65%), hydrochloric acid (35%), and hydrofluoric acid (48%) were used for sample digestion. A 0.05 mol/L EDTA solution was prepared as an ammonium salt solution by dissolving the appropriate amount of salt in concentrated ammonia solution, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.05. A 0.43 mol/L acetic acid solution was prepared by adequate dilution of glacial acetic acid, and a 0.50 mol/L pyridine solution was prepared by diluting concentrated pyridine solution. All three extractant solutions were stored in polyethylene bottles.

**Single Extraction Procedure**

The EDTA, acetic acid, and pyridine single extractions were applied to all pretreated sludge samples. Two replicates of each sample (for each extractant) were obtained. The extractions were conducted in 50 mL capacity glass tubes, which were also used for centrifugation to prevent sample loss. Approximately 2.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g of pretreated sludge were placed into the centrifuge tubes, and 25, 40, and 30 mL of 0.05 mol/L EDTA solution, 0.43 mol/L acetic acid, and 0.50 mol/L pyridine were added, respectively. The mixtures were shaken for 1 hour at laboratory temperature using a magnetic shaker. After shaking, the suspensions were centrifuged for 12 minutes at 2500 rpm. The supernatants were quantitatively transferred to 50 mL volumetric flasks, decanted into polyethylene bottles, and stored at 4°C until analysis. Blank extractions were carried out in parallel for each set of analysis using the same procedure.

**Total and Pseudototal Digestions**

The total metal content in the sludges was determined by completely dissolving the sample matrix using a wet digestion procedure. A 1.0 g sample was placed in a 250 cm³ round-bottomed quick-fit Pyrex flask, and 50 cm³ of a mixture of 30 mL nitric acid (65%), 6 mL hydrochloric acid (35%), and 14 mL hydrofluoric acid (48%) were added to decompose the siliceous material. The flask was connected to a 50 cm tall Vigreux column and a 25 cm tall Liebig's condenser unit. The entire assembly was heated on an electric plate for approximately 6 hours until clear solutions were obtained. The solutions were then cooled, filtered through acid-washed Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and made up to a final volume of 100 cm³ using doubly distilled water. The solutions were stored at 4°C prior to analysis.

Pseudototal digestions were conducted similarly, but only 30 mL of nitric acid (65%) and 6 mL of doubly distilled water were mixed with 0.1 g of the sludge sample.

**Results**

The analytical results obtained from the total and pseudototal digestion methods for domestic and industrial sludge samples are summarized in Table 2. The values are given as the average of duplicate determinations. Interestingly, domestic sludges are not always less polluted than industrial sludges. In the three industrial sludges analyzed, only sample IS1 had total heavy metal contents higher than those of the domestic sludges for all elements studied. The other industrial sludge samples (IS2 and IS3) had lower total heavy metal contents than the domestic sludges. The pseudototal digestion results (Table 1) were generally smaller than the total digestion values, with significant differences in Hg and Pb contents across domestic and industrial sludges. 

**Discussion and Conclusion**

The results of elemental analysis using total and pseudototal digestion methods revealed that industrial wastewaters, particularly in the case of sample IS1, have higher levels of Hg and Cd due to the use of these metals in various products like batteries and thermometers. These results also suggest that industrial wastewaters undergo some treatment before discharge, resulting in lower total heavy metal content compared to untreated domestic wastewaters. However, the total metal content found in all the analyzed domestic and industrial sludges, except for Hg in IS1, does not pose a significant pollution risk in agricultural uses.

The comparison between total and pseudototal digestion methods showed good agreement in most cases. The relative extraction percentages ranged from 5.12 to 100% for Pb, Cd, and Zn in domestic sludges, with Hg exhibiting the lowest extraction efficiency. In industrial sludges, extraction efficiencies were also high for Zn and Cd, with values ranging from 85.9 to 100%.
