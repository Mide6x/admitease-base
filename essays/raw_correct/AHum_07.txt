Urhobo Language

All Urhobo people speak and understand one universal language called Urhobo. For a people who have emigrated from diverse directions at different times, to speak and understand a common language requires some explanation. There have been no philological studies of the Urhobo language to explain its origin and expansion. Certain questions arise when considering the genesis and growth of the Urhobo language:

Were there aborigines on the land whose language was Urhobo before the arrival of foreigners from Benin, Igbo, Ijo, and Isoko?

If most of the founding fathers of the twenty-two kingdoms migrated from Benin, as their traditions suggest, why wasn’t the Bini language dominant after the amalgamation of the new settlers into the area?

What is the cause of the diversity of dialects in the Urhobo language?

Whatever explanation one may attempt for these questions can only be speculative, as no authentic answer exists to the first question. It has not been definitively stated that there were aboriginal Urhobo people in the area before the incursion of the new settlers. However, the oral traditions of the Olomu and Eghwu peoples suggest that there were some Urhobo aborigines in these areas before the arrival of foreigners. According to Nabofa, some of the Olomu aborigines were overpowered by Igboze, who used his Benin influence to suppress them. Similarly, at Eghwu, there were aboriginal people who lost their identity to the newcomers.

The large influx of immigrants likely contributed to their dominance over the local population, but the survival of the Urhobo language can be explained as it was the only means of communication between the natives and the foreigners. The newcomers probably learned the language of the aborigines before they began to suppress them.

The second question, regarding why the Benin language did not gain prominence, can be explained in terms of distance and the permanent separation of the immigrants from their original homes. As a language moves away from its core area, it tends to lose its original form, much like American English diverged from British English due to distance. The circumstances that led the migrants to depart from their original homes were likely harrowing, making them non-nostalgic toward their original language, which may have led to the acquisition of a new language. In time, the immigrants likely became oblivious to their original language, though some words, phrases, or expressions may have remained in the new language. This might explain why some words in the Benin language appear in Urhobo, such as “Igho” (money), “ọmọ” (child), and “ese” (blessing).

One more point regarding the decline of the Benin language is that many ancestors of the Urhobo kingdoms who migrated from Benin bore names that sound alien to Urhobo speakers. For example, “Oghwoghwa” has no direct association with any Urhobo experience in life, as the Urhobo meaning could be “a load carrier” or “a money sprayer.” Other names like “Avwraka,” “Agbon,” “Eghwu,” “Ughwerun,” and “Ughievwen” also sound more Bini than Urhobo. On the other hand, names like “Afiesere,” “Ufuoma,” “Uduophori,” “Adjekota,” and “Oteri” clearly indicate Urhobo expressions.

All Urhobo kingdoms speak a general Urhobo language, which serves as an important instrument of cohesion among the kingdoms. The Urhobo nation, a political and social unit, is defined by this linguistic code, ensuring that their loyalty to the nation remains strong.

Urhobo Dialects

There are twenty-two dialects in the Urhobo language, corresponding to the twenty-two kingdoms or polities in the area. A dialect an Urhobo person speaks indicates their kingdom of origin. Despite variations in dialect, food, clothing, marriage systems, administrative systems, and religious observances are nearly the same throughout Urhobo land. The traditional occupations of Urhobo people include farming and palm collection, with those in riverine areas also engaging in fishing. Burial ceremonies are also organized similarly across all the kingdoms.

Although Urhobo people across different kingdoms may speak different dialects, they can understand one another. For instance, someone from Orogun kingdom can understand another person speaking Eghwu dialect but cannot express themselves in that dialect. This mutual intelligibility, despite dialect differences, is essential to the unity of the Urhobo people.

Schiller, Welch, Nicholas, and Jenkins (1972) define a dialect as a variety of a language spoken by a group of people in a particular geographic location. This definition explains the relationship between the Urhobo language and its various dialects. All Urhobo people speak and understand the general Urhobo language, but each kingdom's dialect may differ slightly in pronunciation, lexical items, and syntax.

The existence of dialects in Urhobo can be explained through the concepts of diachronic and synchronic language change. Diachronic change refers to historical changes that occur over time, while synchronic change describes differences within a language at a given time. The Urhobo dialects evolved through the movements of settlers, with each settlement developing its own variation of the language. For example, people in kingdoms like Oghara and Idjerhe, which were near Benin and Itsekiri, experienced influences from these languages, resulting in modifications in their Urhobo. Similarly, the dialects of Agbon and Okpe, which claim descent from Isoko, show influences from their neighboring group.

The pronunciation of certain words across different kingdoms illustrates the dialectical variations. For instance, people from Ughelli, Agbarha, Ogor, Eghwu, and Arhavwarien kingdoms pronounce “mortar” as “udo,” while people from Agbon, Okpe, and other kingdoms pronounce it “urho.” These variations in pronunciation, as well as differences in lexical items like “bag” (ekpu vs. akpa), highlight the dialectical diversity in Urhobo.
