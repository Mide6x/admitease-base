The Issue with Existing Works on Terrorism

Most existing literature on terrorism tends to focus on addressing the symptoms and consequences rather than delving into the root causes of the issue to find a sustainable solution. Often, the analyses lack objectivity as individuals adhere to interpretations that align with their group interests. For example, the narrative propagated by Americans portrays those perpetrating terrorist acts as enemies of democracy. The 9/11 Commission Reports suggested that contemporary terrorism is rooted in a culture of animosity towards the West, particularly America, stemming from deep religious disparities, indoctrination, idiosyncrasies, and political failures of states that gained independence from Western powers. The reports highlighted economic shortcomings and resulting social repression in these states, leading to widespread resentment among the populace due to government ineffectiveness and frustration.

Osama bin Laden was depicted in the report as an individual with narrow-minded, disoriented, and baseless beliefs who garnered substantial support from the Islamic world by invoking cultural and religious references from the Holy Quran. Bin Laden was portrayed as appealing to individuals grappling with the challenges of modernity and globalization by selectively drawing from Islamic teachings and regional history to justify political and economic grievances.

The U.S. maintains that a faction of the Islamic world views America as a disruptor of civilization, having dismantled the caliphate and supported secular governments over Islamic fundamentalists in various regions. The U.S. argues that the failure of Islamic fundamentalists to assert themselves in post-colonial Arab nations facilitated their exclusion from emerging governments. The U.S. also accuses Arab regimes of mismanaging oil wealth, neglecting sustainable development, and fostering resentment among their citizens through corrupt practices and monopolization of national resources.

Moreover, the U.S. overlooks significant religious disparities between the West and terrorists, as Bin Laden simplifies it as a desire for death over life, highlighting contrasting views on suicide between Western and Islamic societies. This disparity is exploited by Bin Laden to indoctrinate followers with selective interpretations promoting altruistic or religious suicide as a path to paradise.

In conclusion, the relationship between terrorism and counter-terrorism forms a complex chain of actions and reactions. While terrorists perceive their actions as defending self-determination against perceived U.S. oppression, the U.S. views such attacks as mindless and unjustifiable, leading to violations of fundamental human rights in the pursuit of security measures. The intricate balance between addressing terrorism and upholding human rights underscores the importance of navigating this delicate web with caution and wisdom.
