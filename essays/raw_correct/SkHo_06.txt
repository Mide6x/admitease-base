Tackling Unemployment

Every year, young, energetic, and vibrant graduates are discharged from the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in two batches. Many of them travel around in search of better opportunities in various multinational companies, private firms, banks, etc., but only a few are fortunate after numerous attempts. I have often pondered how unemployment can be prevalent in a country like Nigeria where barriers to business have not been firmly established (politicians have not prioritized this). How long will people sit idly by, waiting for the government to provide jobs? Do we genuinely believe the government can create jobs for everyone? What will happen to those who are not lucky enough to secure employment? These thoughts weigh heavily on me, which led me to decide to write about youth empowerment, at least for a series of four, as I believe empowering the youth is crucial because they are the future of Nigeria, and if they falter, the nation will suffer. Each time I see the despair on the faces of highly qualified yet unemployed individuals on the streets, it deeply affects me.

The reality is that the average young Nigerian's mindset is to attend school, excel academically, and then seek a well-paying job. There is a lack of focus on creating job opportunities, which perpetuates the cycle of job scarcity for job seekers. It is baffling to witness families where every member is unemployed, not due to a lack of qualified individuals but because they struggle to find employment. I believe there are numerous opportunities in this country once individuals shift away from the mindset of merely seeking jobs or opening a conventional shop. People need to foster innovation; indeed, our country exhibits a significant entrepreneurial spirit, surpassing that of any other sub-Saharan African nation. Let me share some insight - in the absence of jobs, there lies an opportunity to generate income. Establishing a vocational school where individuals can learn technical skills could be a viable option. By securing a venue, possibly a school for evening classes, and recruiting skilled instructors in their respective fields, this endeavor could be successful. Funding can be sourced from local government authorities, politicians, or companies. You never know what you can accomplish until you start thinking and taking action.

As a recent graduate, engaging in temporary jobs to earn some income before your NYSC program and initiating a venture could be beneficial. Making sacrifices during your service year to save money and preparing to start a small business post-service, based on your expertise, can lead to success if you remain focused. For young entrepreneurs, this could be an opportunity for growth. The packaging industry in Nigeria remains largely untapped. Simple products like garri, palm oil, or plantain chips could be reimagined in innovative packaging to attract consumers willing to pay a premium for quality. With a population exceeding 150 million, satisfying just 1% of this populace and making a small profit per customer could result in significant earnings. Thorough market research and identifying the needs of your target market are essential for success.

In conclusion, altering your mindset towards job creation, no matter how modest your beginnings, and staying committed can lead to remarkable achievements. Bishop David Oyedepo initiated the Winners' Chapel with only his family as congregants. It is time for the youth of Nigeria to raise their voices and guide this great nation towards the right path. We hold the power to effect change, and I urge young individuals to reflect on their unique abilities. Each person possesses distinctive qualities, akin to fingerprints; therefore, delve deep within yourself to discover your potential. I will continue with the second part of this series in two weeks.
