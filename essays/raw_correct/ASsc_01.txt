Introduction
In Nigeria, efforts have been made over the years to ensure that consumers have access to information about the products they consume. As a result, agencies such as the Consumer Protection Council (CPC), the Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON), and others were established to ensure that standards are maintained with regard to products (CPC, 2004; SON, 2004).

In 1999, the Nigerian government, under President Olusegun Obasanjo, intensified this campaign by creating the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) as a parastatal under the Federal Ministry of Health. The goal was to ensure that standards are maintained, particularly concerning Nigerian consumers. The establishment of cottage industries in Nigeria can be attributed to economic hardship and the need for survival. In this regard, several bakeries, packaged water companies, and other industries that have emerged in recent times must be monitored, especially in the interest of consumers. Monitoring these industries involves disseminating information about their products to consumers via the media and other available channels. Currently, one of these channels is through NAFDAC labels (in the form of numbers and information statements) on all NAFDAC-certified products. Some manufacturers have also been instructed to label their products, informing consumers that specific conditions have been met. For example, water packaged in sachets is labeled with NAFDAC numbers as a source of information for the public. Similarly, bakers in Nigeria have been instructed to label bread with the inscription "Bromate Free." These labels serve as a means of informing the public that products with NAFDAC certification meet the required standards (NAFDAC, 2000).

Statement of the Problem
Organizations responsible for information dissemination and standard maintenance argue that their aims and objectives can be effectively achieved through public sensitization and awareness programs, either on the product itself or through other means such as print and electronic media (CPC, 2004; SON, 2004). In their opinion, this approach will ensure that consumers treat a product’s warning and information labels with the seriousness they deserve before consumption. Given the developments in product labeling over the past 30 years, it is important to determine whether consumers observe product labels before purchasing and consuming selected products for this study.

Studies have shown that the consumption of certain food products can be harmful to one’s health. For instance, impure water can cause illnesses such as typhoid fever (Shenge and Babalola, 2003), and the addition of potassium bromate to bread can result in symptoms like a cough, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hearing loss (Kurokwa, 1982; NAFDAC, 1993). Similarly, the impact of tobacco consumption on smokers, due to smoking and unhygienic eating habits, is significant (Akinola, 2004; Idowu, 2004).

Regulatory bodies take daily steps to ensure proper sensitization of consumers (NAFDAC, 2002; SON, 2004). However, empirical evidence suggests that not enough is being done to sensitize consumers in terms of information dissemination (Okeibunor, 1999; Olaniyi, 2002; Akinrimisa, 2003; Adekunle, 2004). For example, reports indicate that the incidence of disease and infection due to consumption-related factors is increasing (Okeibunor, 1999; Olaniyi, 2002; Akinrimisa, 2003; Adekunle, 2004). The significant amount of money spent on advertising, billboards, and public awareness campaigns cannot be overlooked. Both private and government organizations spend substantial sums annually to sensitize the public. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the level of knowledge and awareness regarding warning and information labels, as well as the factors influencing the observance or non-observance of these labels by consumers, in order to establish the relationship among these variables. This is important given the growing public awareness of the importance of what people consume (Miller and Ginter, 1985) and the pressing need to maintain a healthy and vibrant nation.

In light of the above discussion, the following questions are pertinent for this study:

Brief Literature Review
Everyone is a consumer, at least in relation to some goods and resources within our economy (Parkinson and Michael, 1994). However, for research purposes, the concept of consumer must be expanded beyond its usual connotation related to the consumption of goods and services from private industries. People are also consumers of services from other types of organizations, such as educational institutions, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. The public consists of users of services provided by policemen, mail carriers, ministers, and other public servants (Parkinson and Michael, 1994).

Several terms have been used to describe labels on products, such as eco-labels or branding. Green (1998) discusses how the British detergent industry (which is almost entirely self-regulated) contributes to water pollution. She argues for stricter eco-labeling of detergents, which, according to the British government, account for nearly 20% of phosphate pollution in the country’s surface waters. Similarly, Mattoo and Singh (1994) used the term "eco-labelling" to refer to branding on products intended to provide information to consumers about what they are about to consume. Other scholars have used the term "branding" to describe labeling on products. Aldersey (1998), in studying pharmaceutical companies’ interests in branding, argues that these companies do so to justify the price of their products.

When consumers consider the information on labels, several factors such as their knowledge and attitude come into play. Aaker and Keller (1990) argue that when consumers fail to interpret a product’s logo correctly, they may not fully understand what the product's information expects of them. A consumer’s knowledge of labels will determine their attitude toward and understanding of the product. Naturally, a lack of knowledge (or inaccurate knowledge) about a product could hinder the development of a positive overall attitude toward it (Hawkins and Best, 1984). For example, a consumer unaware that a product like Nescafe exists will not develop any attitude toward it.

Regardless of the name used for product labels, there are clear intentions behind their use. From the manufacturers' perspective, labels may be used to make their products stand out from others and encourage buyers to choose their products over those of competitors. Aldersey (1998: 45) further suggests that "manufacturers want a way to distinguish their products from copycat rivals and to justify their prices against non-branded generic drugs." Firms use labels to facilitate the acceptance of their products when entering new markets (Aaker, 1990).

It is clear that manufacturers are interested in giving their products unique names, appearances, and other characteristics to justify their prices at the point of sale. This means that when products with similar functions are available in the market, the product with a distinctive label will receive more consideration, regardless of its price. There is a growing emphasis on information and branding in marketing. Charles Leadbeater (1998) opines:

“… in the world of the new capitalism, to create wealth, a company must give away its products: for a product to become standard, it has to become ubiquitous. Laws of old capitalism are being rewritten, and a shift is occurring from an economy driven by mass labor to an economy in which advanced companies rely on intangible assets like creativity, knowledge, information, and branding.”

Manufacturers continually seek ways to increase their profit margins, and labeling is one such strategy. The financial risks of entering new markets have become significant for many consumer product manufacturers (Aaker, 1990). As a result, there has been a shift from old paradigms to new methods for entering markets and maximizing profits. While manufacturers look for ways to increase profit margins, policymakers are also interested in labels due to their potential impact on consumers. Product labeling benefits firms that face the challenge of introducing new products, as it leverages brand name recognition and image to ease market entry (Aaker and Keller, 1990). Policymakers believe that not all consumers have the same level of access to information about what they consume. Therefore, it is important for them to act as gatekeepers to ensure that manufacturers place labels on products. Mattoo and Hasha (1994) argue that labeling reduces market demand for products made using environmentally harmful methods. It appears that the primary motivation for adopting product labels by policymakers is to safeguard the health of consumers.

From the consumers' perspective, in line with classical economic theory, people tend to consume based on the price of a product. Consumers are more likely to purchase goods that are economically priced: "The first trend is that people increasingly buy goods based on price, not because they carry a famous name" (The Economist, 1994: 13). However, this statement may not apply to all situations, particularly among higher-status individuals in society. High-status individuals may be more inclined to purchase goods with labels that make them more expensive, as a means of signaling their social status.

Theoretical Framework
The guiding theory for this study is Symbolic Interactionism. Developed by John Dewey, Herbert Mead, and W.I. Thomas, Symbolic Interactionism seeks to explain social actions in terms of the meanings individuals attach to symbols, objects, or events within their social environment (Haralambos, 2000). Mead (1934) argues that human thoughts, experiences, and behaviors are inherently social. For Mead, symbols do not merely represent objects or events; they define them in particular ways and indicate how people are expected to respond to them.

Symbols, derived from social interaction, impose meanings on objects and events, largely excluding alternative interpretations (Ritzer, 1996; Haralambos, 2000). Symbols enable meaningful interaction with both the natural and social environments. These symbols are human-made and refer to the ways in which people perceive them. Symbolic Interactionism is essential because humans lack the instinct to direct their behavior. Humans are not genetically programmed to automatically react to certain stimuli. To survive, they must construct and live in a world of meanings, which must be communicated and shared. Social life thus progresses through role-taking, which involves sharing symbols within society. This process ensures effective communication, as each person involved must interpret the meanings and intentions of others, responding accordingly (Ritzer, 1996). Symbolic Interactionism explains that people derive meanings from objects (including product labels) and act accordingly.
