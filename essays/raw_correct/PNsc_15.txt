Cervical Cancer: Controlling the Deadly Disease

Women who gathered in Anthony Village, Lagos over the weekend learned valuable lessons, one of which is the importance of undergoing medical tests and screenings to prevent diseases that can be manageable when detected early, according to Davidson Iriekpen.

Last year, a renowned Force Public Relations Officer and former Kaduna State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Haz Iwendi, complained of minor discomfort on a Wednesday. By the following Monday, he had passed away after being in a coma for four days. In Benin-City, the capital of Edo State, a recent study of two hundred senior executives aged 25 to 64 revealed that 70 percent were shocked to discover they were hypertensive. Nearly every Nigerian is either related to or knows someone who has died suddenly from preventable illnesses. These deaths sadly indicate a reluctance to address minor illnesses that are preventable with simple medication and a healthy lifestyle.

A medical check-up is a comprehensive physical examination of the body, including various tests based on the individual's age, gender, and medical history. It's evident that a majority of Nigerians do not undergo regular check-ups due to economic constraints, lack of awareness, and reluctance to undergo testing.

The thought of getting a medical check-up when not feeling ill is rare. Most people prefer self-medication and prioritize money for daily needs over health check-ups, which they consider a waste of money, especially if they appear outwardly healthy. However, who knows what underlying diseases may be silently progressing? The days when robust cheeks and potbellies symbolized affluence are long gone; refined sugars, excessive salt in foods, and unhealthy lifestyle habits are on the rise despite economic challenges.

In light of these issues, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Morning Star Parish in Anthony Village, Lagos, organized a free cervical and breast cancer screening during its "Family Month" activities. The goal of the screening and tests was to inform women about their health status and educate them about the risks of these deadly diseases and preventive measures.

In recent times, cervical cancer, in particular, has garnered global attention. This disease not only causes concern among older and middle-aged women but also among teenagers. Even the medical community has yet to fully understand the sudden surge of this disease, which is spreading rapidly in unprecedented ways.

Experts attribute cervical cancer to the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), a disease in which cancer cells are found in the cervix tissues. Unlike other cancers, cervical cancer can be prevented through vaccination for women. Despite being easily preventable if detected early, there is insufficient awareness about it in Nigeria. Research has shown that most Nigerian women lack adequate knowledge about the importance of early detection of cervical cancer.

A recent study conducted by Dr. Gabriel Olabiyi Ogun from the Department of Pathology, University College Hospital, Ibadan, and Ronald Bejide from the Department of Morbid Anatomy and Forensic Pathology, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, identified numerous reasons for the high prevalence of this preventable cancer in Nigeria. The study revealed that 85 percent of the population had poor knowledge and negative attitudes towards screening and examination, attributed to cultural, religious, and informational barriers, as well as a lack of political will, funding, advocacy, and healthcare professionals.

Professor Isaac Adewole, a university lecturer, highlighted that over 10,000 Nigerian women die annually from cervical cancer, often in painful and undignified ways. He emphasized the urgent need for the Federal Government to implement measures for prevention, early detection, and effective management of cervical and breast cancer to reduce the staggering incidence and mortality rates among women.

He noted that cervical cancer perpetuates a cycle of poverty, affecting low-income women who lack access to healthcare facilities. Adewole stressed that without swift action, the nation would continue to witness a rise in cancer cases and deaths among women, impacting families and communities heavily reliant on women as providers and caregivers.

Dr. Erere Otrofanowei, Director of Sponsorship at the National Cervical Cancer Prevention Programme (NCCPP), highlighted the alarming statistics of cervical cancer in Nigeria. She emphasized the need for early detection through screening to prevent cervical cancer from progressing. Otrofanowei underscored the challenges in raising awareness and providing adequate healthcare services to combat the disease effectively.

Otrofanowei explained that HPV, the primary cause of cervical cancer, affects millions globally and can lead to cancer if left untreated. She emphasized the importance of early detection through screening, as symptoms may not appear until the disease has advanced irreversibly.

She noted that cervical cancer rates have significantly decreased in developed countries due to universal screening programs. Otrofanowei urged Nigeria to adopt similar strategies to reduce the high prevalence of cervical cancer, stressing the importance of regular screenings and examinations in combating the disease.

The Pastor of the parish, Supo Omisakin, encouraged members to prioritize their health by attending regular medical check-ups, aligning with the teachings of Pastor Enoch A. Adeboye, the General Overseer of RCCG, on healthy living. Omisakin emphasized that faith does not preclude individuals from seeking medical care, as knowledge is essential for overall well-being.

The free cervical and breast cancer screening organized by the church aimed to educate women and teenage girls about the importance of early detection and prevention of these diseases. Through community outreach and awareness campaigns, the church seeks to empower individuals to take control of their health and contribute to the fight against preventable illnesses.

In conclusion, it is crucial for individuals to prioritize their health through regular screenings and examinations to detect diseases early and prevent unnecessary suffering and loss of lives. Awareness, education, and access to healthcare services play a vital role in combating deadly diseases like cervical cancer and improving public health outcomes.
