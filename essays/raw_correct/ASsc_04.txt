Besides, the UN suffers from basic structural defects in its ability to comprehensively respond to conflicts. The proposed conflict management system is based on the utilization of problem-solving techniques to comprehensively address the phenomenon of adversarial relationships within the global context, at three levels. These levels are referred to as an integrated conflict management circle, comprising conflict prevention and peace promotion, conflict control and abatement, and conflict resolution. The idea behind this three-level conflict management circle is to ensure that efforts at conflict management consciously strive to eliminate the conditions that create an environment of conflict and discord within the global system. It is designed to ensure that, even if conflict occurs despite such efforts, it is managed productively to prevent it from escalating into open violence or to minimize the level of violence, which could potentially lead to terrorism and war.

At the conflict prevention level, measures such as sound behavioral codes, the encouragement of democracy, confidence-building initiatives, and the promotion of inter-State or inter-group cooperation and integration are often necessary to reduce the incidence of conflict. For the UN to make a meaningful impact in this area, it should initiate a process of evolving a genuine new world order, collectively designed, to be incorporated into the behavioral code to guide its members. The UN could achieve this by organizing a global conference to thoroughly re-examine the current global arrangement with a view to effecting the necessary systemic corrections. This process could begin at the regional level before culminating in the global phase. The delegates to the proposed conference should represent all the regions of the world and include religious and other civil society groups, ensuring gender balance.

In addition to this, there is a need to build a global coalition against the reckless resort to armed conflict. The focus of such a coalition should be on a systematic campaign promoting the demilitarization of the international system and the diversion of world resources from military purposes to the elimination of all forms of human misery. The support of religious and other civil society groups could be enlisted to propagate the objectives of the campaign. With a demonstrable global commitment to genuinely addressing the human problems afflicting the world, the frustration driving people into terrorism would be greatly minimized. Moreover, any coercive measures taken against terrorism would stand on sound moral ground.

Peacekeeping and other peace-support measures fall under the category of conflict control and abatement. This is where the UN has been relatively active through its peacekeeping and other peace-support operations. What is needed at this level is an injection of more resources into UN peacekeeping and peace-support operations, enabling the organization to carry out timely interventions with built-in capabilities for enforcement when necessary. Nonetheless, there should be conscious efforts to minimize the number of conflicts escalating to this level of management by ensuring effective action at the conflict prevention and peace promotion stage.

Finally, at the conflict resolution level, where the fundamental issues affecting the conflict are addressed, the UN needs to improve its capacity to facilitate intensive negotiations between conflicting parties. To effectively perform this vital role in eliminating violence from adversarial relationships, the UN would need to establish a corps of mediators to form a UN negotiating team that can be deployed to mediate or facilitate conflict situations. This negotiating team should consist of individuals who can devote their time and energy to the sometimes-protracted negotiations needed to resolve deep-rooted conflicts. Additionally, adequate resources should be made available to enable the team to take timely action to “catch conflict young”—that is, to bring the parties to the negotiating table at an early stage, before the conflict escalates into violence. The integrated conflict management model being suggested here holds particular significance for Africa, given the continent’s unique challenges.

Integrated Conflict Management Approach to Counter-Terrorism: Its Special Significance for Africa

For Africa, the integrated conflict management model proposed in this study offers a more reliable approach to addressing terrorism on the continent. While African states may not be directly threatened by terrorism, the prevailing conditions in many African countries mark the continent as a potential arena for terrorist threats. Africa is unlikely to remain immune to terrorism, given its present conditions of poverty amid abundance, the mismanagement of its immense resources by its leaders, and the widespread phenomenon of bad governance across its political landscape. Furthermore, considering the global spread of terrorism and the tendency for societies not directly involved in conflicts to fall victim to terrorism by association, it makes sense for current regional security efforts in Africa to be based on well-articulated preventive measures aimed at keeping the continent relatively free from terrorist activities.

This integrated conflict management system is particularly important for Africa for several reasons. Although Africa is richly endowed with both human and material resources, many African countries have not developed the technological and industrial capacity to play a significant role in the current militaristic approach to terrorism. As of now, most African countries are importers rather than producers of military equipment. Only Egypt and South Africa are capable of managing significant emergencies without relying on external sources for military hardware. If African states choose to adopt the current American-led militaristic approach to combating terrorism, they would need to depend on the U.S. and its allies for military means to address the situation. This would exacerbate their problem of external dependency and erode their control over strategic deployments.

Even if the U.S. and its close allies temporarily assist African states with military procurement for counter-terrorism efforts, African countries will eventually have to confront the problem independently. The militaristic option could turn out to be a drain on their foreign exchange reserves. In contrast, the militaristic response to terrorism benefits industrial powers, including the U.S., whose economy has been stimulated by the "war on terror." The military-industrial complexes in these countries have profited from the ongoing conflict, while the African states have borne the economic and strategic costs.

Thus, it is in the best interest of African states to decouple themselves from this open-ended war and embrace the proposed integrated conflict management approach to address terrorism in Africa.
