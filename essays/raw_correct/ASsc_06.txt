ABSTRACT

Numerous research studies have established that breast milk is superior to other types of milk in nourishing human infants, offering significant health benefits. Early childhood is marked by rapid growth, tissue maturation, and organ remodeling. Breastfeeding is the optimal method for infant feeding, as it provides the right amounts and duration of essential nutrients. However, in Nigeria, many young infants do not benefit from breastfeeding due to delayed initiation and the introduction of alternative liquids that undermine breast milk. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing breastfeeding practices in Edo State, Nigeria. A questionnaire and group interviews were used as the instruments for data collection. The study surveyed 600 randomly selected mothers of children aged 4-24 months who visited four antenatal and pediatric clinics. Data were analyzed using percentiles, means, and standard deviations. The findings indicated that 82% of mothers practiced breastfeeding, but 66% supplemented with corn gruel and glucose water, and 14% used herbal brews. Only 20% of mothers practiced exclusive breastfeeding. Among the variables affecting breastfeeding practices, proximity to the baby (mean score of 4.63, SD ± 0.66) was the most influential, while family background (mean score of 2.32, SD ± 0.92) was the least influential. The study's findings have important implications for health education programs, emphasizing the need to educate mothers about the importance of breastfeeding. The UNICEF-WHO Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative should be extended beyond university teaching hospitals to other public and private hospitals. Additionally, the provision of creches at workplaces and markets could reduce the distance between mothers and their babies, thereby increasing breastfeeding rates.

INTRODUCTION

The superiority of breast milk over other types of milk for nourishing human infants, offering significant health benefits, has been well-established by numerous research studies [3, 14, 15]. Recent years have brought exciting developments concerning the biochemical, anti-infective, emotional, and economic benefits of breastfeeding [4, 13, 14]. To promote successful breastfeeding worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) launched the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in 1991. This global initiative involves 160 countries, including 95 developing nations, such as Nigeria [15]. The BFHI aims to support, promote, and protect the practice of exclusive breastfeeding [9]. The WHO and UNICEF recommend that infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months and continued breastfeeding be practiced until 24 months.

In Nigeria, the government has designated six university teaching hospitals as BFHI centers—Benin, Enugu, Maiduguri, Lagos, Jos, and Port Harcourt—to reduce infant malnutrition, morbidity, and mortality, while promoting maternal health. Since its inception, the BFHI has been effective in improving breastfeeding practices globally [11]. Despite these efforts, breastfeeding rates have not reached 100%, indicating the need for intensified nutrition education for mothers on the importance of breastfeeding [6, 7, 8, 12]. In developing countries like Nigeria, many pregnant women still deliver their babies at home, or have brief hospital stays, which hampers the impact of the BFHI [4]. The Nigerian Integrated Child Health Cluster Survey (ICHCS, 2003) identified early initiation of breastfeeding as a major area of concern. Newborns are expected to be put to the breast within an hour of delivery, but the survey revealed a decline in early initiation from 56% in 2000 to 34% in 2002.

Various factors, beyond health considerations, often influence the decision to breastfeed [5]. To design effective promotional activities and set national breastfeeding goals, assessing breastfeeding rates and the factors influencing these practices is essential [2]. This study was conducted to assess breastfeeding practices and the factors influencing these practices among mothers of children aged 4-24 months in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. The findings of this study provide critical insights for promoting breastfeeding practices in the region.
