ABSTRACT
Various research publications have established the superiority of breast milk over other types of milk for nourishing human infants, offering better health benefits. Breastfeeding is the optimal method for infant feeding as it provides all the necessary nutrients in the right amounts and duration. In Nigeria, however, challenges such as poor early initiation and the use of alternative liquids hinder infants from benefiting from breastfeeding. This study aimed to identify factors influencing breastfeeding practices in Edo State, Nigeria. Data was collected from 600 mothers of children aged 4-24 months using questionnaires and group interviews. The findings revealed that while 82% of mothers practiced breastfeeding, only 20% exclusively breastfed. Proximity to the baby was identified as the most influential factor, while family background had the least impact. The study highlights the importance of health education programs and efforts to promote breastfeeding practices.

INTRODUCTION
Research publications have highlighted the benefits of breastfeeding for infant health. The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) launched the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) to promote and support exclusive breastfeeding globally. Despite these efforts, breastfeeding rates have not reached optimal levels, necessitating enhanced nutrition education for mothers. This study aims to assess breastfeeding practices in Edo State, Nigeria, and identify influencing factors to guide health promotion strategies.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A survey and focus group design were employed to study breastfeeding practices among mothers in Benin City, Edo State. A sample of 600 mothers with children aged 4-24 months from various clinics was randomly selected. Data collection involved questionnaires and group interviews, focusing on socio-demographic factors and variables influencing breastfeeding practices. Statistical analysis was conducted using means, standard deviations, and percentiles to interpret the data.

RESULTS
The study revealed that 82% of mothers practiced breastfeeding, with only 20% practicing exclusive breastfeeding. Factors such as proximity to the baby were found to significantly influence breastfeeding practices, while family background had minimal impact. The study emphasizes the importance of creating awareness about breastfeeding benefits and suggests interventions like providing creches at workplaces to facilitate breastfeeding.

DISCUSSION
The study highlights the need to improve exclusive breastfeeding rates in Edo State, Nigeria. Despite high breastfeeding prevalence, exclusive breastfeeding remains low. Factors like lack of awareness and economic constraints contribute to suboptimal breastfeeding practices. Enhancing education on breastfeeding benefits and addressing challenges like proximity to the baby are crucial for promoting optimal breastfeeding practices in the region.
