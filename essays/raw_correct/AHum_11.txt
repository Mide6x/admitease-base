It has been mentioned earlier that Hausa serves as a lingua franca in all the states in Northern Nigeria. Furthermore, Hausa is taught as a school subject at every level, from primary school to university. The overall status of Hausa in Nigeria is that it is a very influential regional language with the potential of becoming a national language.

Nigeria, as a sovereign nation today, has passed through two important stages of political development: first, as a nation under colonial rule, and second, as an independent nation with full self-rule. Independent Nigeria was first fragmented into regions and later into states. We may wish to ask how Nigerian languages fared during the two opposing administrative periods. In particular, this paper discusses the position of Hausa in colonial and post-colonial Nigeria. It is pertinent to note the overlap between the period of colonial administration and the transitional period of self-government before independence. Thus, this paper refers to this period as colonial-cum-northern regional government. The period of full independent rule, when states were first created, will also be considered up to the present day.

The paper is divided into five sections. Section one is the general introduction. Section two discusses the early European interest in Hausa. Section three traces the development of Hausa studies under colonial-cum-northern regional government. Section four deals with the fragmentation of Hausa under the state governments. The last section provides recommendations for the upliftment of Hausa as a language and as a field of study.

**2. Early European Interest in Hausa**

The study of Hausa by Europeans began in the 1840s. Hausa was first reduced to writing using the Roman script in 1843 by a German missionary named James Fredrick Schon. J.F. Schon wrote several books on Hausa, two of which deserve special mention. In 1885, Schon wrote *Magana Hausa*, a book containing Hausa stories and believed to be the first full-fledged book written in Hausa using the Roman script. Schon was also credited with writing a dictionary in 1876 entitled *Dictionary of the Hausa Language*. We must appreciate the fact that the orthography developed for Hausa by J.F. Schon in his works closely resembles the present-day Standard Hausa Orthography.

In 1890, a London-based society called the 'Hausa Society' sponsored Charles H. Robins to conduct research on the Hausa language. Robins was the first researcher to introduce the use of dots beneath the Hausa sounds b, d, and k (i.e. b, d, k) to represent the present hooked letters b, d, and k. He also introduced the marking of tone to distinguish words in Hausa.

The period from 1840 to 1899 is considered the period of early European interest in Hausa studies. During this time, considerable work was done on all aspects of Hausa (i.e., language, literature, and culture). In 1911, B. Stuck attempted a bibliography in the *Journal of the African Society* and listed about 237 works on various aspects of Hausa.

**3. Hausa under the Colonial-cum-Northern Regional Government**

British colonial rule in Northern Nigeria began in 1900, and in 1914, the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Nigeria brought the entire country under a unified British colonial administration. It is important to note that all works done on Hausa by Europeans prior to 1900 were primarily sponsored by missionaries or independent societies in Europe. However, from 1900 onward, the colonial administration became involved in the promotion of Hausa studies.

In the first half of the 20th century (1900-1950), there was an influx of works on various aspects of Hausa studies. Some of the significant works include dictionaries, grammar books, and rules of orthography. Roxana Ma Newman (1974) reported that Reverend George Percy Bargery's *Hausa-English Dictionary and English-Hausa Vocabulary* was ranked among the most important linguistic works done in the first half of the 20th century.
