How to Reduce Sugar Overload in the Body (Sugar Detox)

If you are feeling run-down, overweight, or moody, you might be experiencing sugar overload. Our expert plan will guide you in eliminating refined sugar from your diet while still enjoying a fulfilling life.

When you depend on sugary treats for energy boosts during tiresome or hectic days, you are likely to experience irritability when the initial sugar rush wears off. Sugar is a genuine addiction â€“ consuming excessive amounts causes your brain to become dependent on its chemical surges, akin to the effects of a drug. However, it is possible to develop new habits, according to Kathleen DesMaisons, Ph.D., an expert in addictive nutrition and author of "Potatoes Not Prozac" (Simon & Schuster, 2008).

Follow these steps to break free from a sugar habit and take charge of your mood swings. It is essential to proceed gradually, as DesMaisons advises, and acknowledge that this is a gradual process. Allotting at least two weeks to one month for each change will contribute to better long-term success.

Eliminating Sugar from Your Diet

1. Start Your Day with Protein
Consume a meal containing at least ten grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking up to stabilize your blood sugar levels. Options like scrambled eggs or tofu, nut butters, and veggie sausage patties are excellent choices.

2. Keep a Food Journal
Track everything you eat to raise awareness of your sugar intake and identify when cravings arise. This practice will help prevent unconscious consumption of sugar.

3. Avoid Snacking
Stick to three meals a day, each with a protein component. While you can include small amounts of various types of sugar, like desserts, consume them only during your meals. Having a full meal helps slow down sugar absorption.

4. Incorporate Supplements
Boost your body's ability to metabolize carbohydrates by taking vitamin B complex (50 mg), vitamin C (500 mg), and zinc (15 mg).

5. Consume a Potato Every Evening
Despite being high on the glycemic index, eating a potato at night can alleviate mood swings and sugar cravings. The insulin response triggered by consuming a whole potato delivers tryptophan (a precursor to serotonin) to the brain.

6. Opt for Whole Grains
Integrate high-fiber whole grains into your diet by choosing whole wheat over white bread and brown rice over white rice, as they help stabilize blood sugar levels.

7. Reduce Sugar Intake
Avoid all refined and sweetened foods such as cereals, candies, packaged cookies, and sugary drinks. Limit consumption of sweet fruits like bananas, kiwis, and apples, and opt for less sweet fruits like berries instead.

Identifying Sugar Sensitivity
Look out for these signs to determine if you are "sugar sensitive," as outlined by Kathleen DesMaisons, Ph.D.:

- Low-level anxiety or depression
- Frequent sugar-craving binges
- Withdrawal symptoms and irritability

Understanding the Types of Sugar

1. Glucose: Derived from starchy foods like vegetables and grains, glucose serves as the body's main energy source.
2. Fructose: Found in fruits, honey, and natural sweeteners, excessive intake of fructose or refined sugar can lead to health issues such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and even cancer.
3. Galactose: Present in dairy and breast milk.

If you struggle to lose weight despite your efforts, excessive fructose intake may be the culprit. This simple sugar, naturally occurring in fruits and sweet vegetables, is also added as high fructose corn syrup to various processed foods. According to Richard Johnson, author of "The Sugar Fix" (Rodale, 2008), fructose quickly converts into body fat and hampers a hormone called leptin, which signals satiety to the brain.

To overcome your sugar addiction and manage weight effectively, consider the following recommendations from Johnson:

- Reduce Fructose Consumption: Avoid high fructose corn syrup and table sugar in processed foods. Limit fructose intake to no more than 35 grams per day.
- Steer Clear of Sugary Drinks: Avoid sodas and be cautious with fruit juices, smoothies, sweetened coffee beverages, and wine coolers that contain high fructose corn syrup. Opt for water, unsweetened coffee, and tea instead.
- Include Starchy Foods: Foods rich in glucose, such as whole wheat pasta, potatoes, and whole-grain bread, can stimulate insulin release, promoting a healthy physiological response.
- Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle: Boost metabolism with 30 minutes of daily exercise, ensure adequate sun exposure for vitamin D, and consume 250 mg of vitamin C daily for antioxidants. Enjoy dark chocolate in moderation to help lower blood pressure.

Embarking on the No-Fructose Challenge
Consuming fructose triggers enzyme production that intensifies cravings. Break this cycle by abstaining from all sources of fructose, including desserts, fruits, and fruit juice, for two weeks. Avoid foods with high fructose corn syrup and gradually reintroduce fructose in moderation after the challenge period.

Recognizing the Health Risks of Excessive Fructose Intake
Overconsumption of fructose can lead to various health concerns, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Look out for symptoms such as excess weight around the waist, low levels of HDL cholesterol, high blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and elevated triglyceride levels.

Monitoring Fructose Intake
To stay within the recommended daily limit of 35 grams of fructose, be mindful of your consumption. Here is a list of fructose-rich foods from Johnson's book, "The Sugar Fix":

- Table sugar, 1 tablespoon: 2.0 grams
- Pineapple, 1 slice: 4.0 grams
- Molasses, 1 tablespoon: 5.5 grams
- Granola, 1/2 cup: 7.0 grams
- Banana, 1 medium: 7.1 grams
- Raisin Bran, 1 cup: 7.6 grams
- Apple, medium: 9.5 grams
- Watermelon, 1/4 melon: 11.3 grams
- Grapes, seedless, 1 cup: 12.4 grams
- Apple pie, 1 slice: 16.5 grams
- Carrot cake, 1 slice: 27.0 grams
- Chocolate cake, 1 slice: 37.0 grams
