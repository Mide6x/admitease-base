It is important to note that neither the SE nor the XLE trim levels feature a folding rear seat, although both include a center pass-through. Many of the XLE's enhancements are available as options on the lower trim levels.
Optional features, depending on the trim level, include a sunroof, a navigation system, keyless ignition and entry, and heated front seats. All Camry models are front-wheel drive, with a standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine generating 169 horsepower, an increase of 11 horsepower compared to the previous 2.4-liter engine. The 3.5-liter V6, producing 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, is available as an option on all models except the base Camry, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.
