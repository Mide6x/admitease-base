Demonstrate care for your customers by noticing their interests and finding small ways to bring them joy. For instance, if your top customer is a football fan, arranging for the local sports section to be sent to them weekly can make a significant impact. Even a simple phone call while you're in the area, even if you can't visit in person, can show your commitment. The emphasis here is on being thoughtful and inexpensive, showing that you care without creating a sense of obligation to purchase.
