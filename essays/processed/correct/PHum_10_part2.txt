The public's involvement in museum affairs has greatly improved museum practices, especially in the selection of objects for display. Nigeria, being a culturally diverse nation, boasts one of the world's richest collections of objects. These objects often showcase cultural similarities among the Nigerian people, reflecting a sense of unity.
Theodore Low aptly noted that museums play a crucial role in shaping ideologies, emphasizing the importance of truth, social cohesion, and mental well-being. Museums have the potential to influence millions of citizens and, therefore, must acknowledge their responsibility in society.
In conclusion, with museums now inviting public collaboration, the onus is on the public to rise to the challenge and ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are met.
