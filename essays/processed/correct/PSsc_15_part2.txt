The issue of child witchcraft gained significant media attention following the documentary "Saving Africa's Witch Children," which received prestigious awards such as BAFTA and Amnesty Film awards. The documentary exposed Helen Ukpabio's role in promoting the belief in child 'witches' in Southeastern Nigeria. Helen Ukpabio's teachings, as outlined in her book "Unveiling the Mysteries of Witchcraft," have sparked international outrage and condemnation due to statements like "a child under two years old who cries at night and experiences health deterioration is a Satan's agent."
