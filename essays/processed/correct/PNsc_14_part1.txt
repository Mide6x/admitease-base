Cervical Cancer: The Silent Killer
Cancer is an umbrella term for more than 100 life-threatening diseases characterized by the uncontrolled, abnormal growth of malignant cells. These harmful cells may spread locally to adjacent tissues or to other locations in the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Cancer may affect people of all ages, but the risk for most varieties increases with age. Cancer causes about 13% of all deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, 7.6 million people died from cancer worldwide in 2007.
Cervical cancer has been proven to be caused by a virus called the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The global prevalence of HPV in cervical carcinoma is 99.7%. Over 100 types of HPV have been discovered, with at least 13 genotypes associated with cancer. The eight most common high-risk genotypes (HPV 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 58, and 35) account for 90% of cases of cervical cancer. Apart from HPV 16 and 18, each individual genotype causes a small (5%) proportion of cases. HPV 16 and 18 account for more than 70% of all cervical cancers worldwide. HPV 31 and 45 are implicated in about 4% of the cases. The low-risk HPV genotypes can cause genital warts or low-grade lesions on the cervical surface. Between 90% and 100% of genital warts are caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 11.
