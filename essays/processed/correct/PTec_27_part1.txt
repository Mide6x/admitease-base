The future is... Convergence.
In 2006, during the VoIP Africa Forum held in Lagos to discuss a complex theme in the industry, all knowledgeable individuals agreed that the industry was undergoing a transition and that the future of the industry would be VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). The regulator, Engineer Ernest Ndukwe, was clear in his statement. VoIP would emerge as the industry's forefront for achieving what seemed impossible. It would challenge the traditional way of doing things, elevate smaller entities into giants, and render incumbents who resisted change obsolete.
Even then, the most conservative and pessimistic individuals in the industry viewed VoIP as just a precursor to something more profound. VoIP was seen as a precursor to a revolutionary reality that would extend beyond the mere transmission of voice packets through soft switches. The industry foresaw the emergence of EoIP - Everything over IP. It is now a reality, marking the era of convergence.
Convergence has arrived. Everything is now integrated into a single conduit, transmitting voice, video, data, and all forms of communication to unify media and content seamlessly. As long as there is bandwidth and soft switch technology, content will flow rapidly, surpassing previous limits.
Most modern networks can offer a variety of services through a single network, such as voice, video, and Internet data delivered through cable TV connections, or a combination of services including broadcast television signals transmitted via wireless phone networks like Multilinks or Starcomms.
The landscape has transformed significantly, except for a few incumbents from the pre-liberalization era and the new private sector giants from the pre-VoIP era who have reshaped the industry. These new incumbents have outpaced the traditional telecom operators with rapid deployment, innovative strategies, and intense competition. The transition to convergence poses challenges and opportunities, where VoIP has disrupted the status quo, driving fear and excitement.
