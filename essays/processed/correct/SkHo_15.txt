Kitchen Tips:
- Potatoes can remove food stains from your fingers. Simply slice and rub raw potato on the stains, then rinse with water.
- If you accidentally oversalt a dish while it's still cooking, add a peeled potato; it will absorb the excess salt instantly.
- Avoid salting meat before cooking as it will extract the juices and toughen it.
- To extract the most juice from fresh lemons, bring them to room temperature and roll them under your palm on the kitchen counter before squeezing.
- To prevent garlic odor lingering on your fingers, coat them with a little olive oil before peeling and chopping. Wash them with soap afterward to eliminate the smell.
- For preventing eggshells from cracking, add a pinch of salt to the water before hard-boiling.
