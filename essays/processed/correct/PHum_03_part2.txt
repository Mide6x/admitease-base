For Bakare, a prominent playwright in Nigeria's third generation, and an associate professor in the Theatre Arts Department at the University of Abuja, participating in Mnet's "Let's Dance" reality television show was a significant step towards celebrating Nigeria's local content on DSTV, powered by Verve. Rasaki frequently tours many countries worldwide to showcase his artistry in stage productions. Over the past 30 years, his creative endeavors have enriched the arts in dance, performance, creation, administration, and theater scholarship.
Currently, he teaches theater, dance, and choreography at the University of Abuja. "Nigerian culture places great importance on treating guests with utmost care and warmth through dance most times. Nigerians enjoy dancing, with soccer, polo, cricket, swimming, and wrestling being popular among the affluent classes. Nigerian culture, dating back 2000 years, stands out due to its diversity," he remarked.
In an email exchange with THISDAY, he expressed that dance is a fundamental aspect of "our cultural expression and is also highly educational. Dance is an art form that typically involves rhythmic body movements set to music, serving as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in spiritual or performance settings.
"Dance is also used to describe non-verbal communication methods between humans or animals, motion in inanimate objects, and certain musical forms or genres. In sports, disciplines like gymnastics, figure skating, and synchronized swimming are akin to dance, while martial arts like karate are often likened to dances.
"Furthermore, I believe Nigerians have learned a great deal from 'Let's Dance.' Our local television stations in Nigeria are not actively promoting our culture through dance. People from other regions are tapping into the benefits presented by our diverse population. MNet recognizes this and has chosen to invest in developing local content for the DStv platform.
