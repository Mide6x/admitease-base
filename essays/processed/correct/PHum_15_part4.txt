Adeyemi believes that art has greatly enriched the country, but asserts that the government has not reciprocated this generosity in supporting the art industry. He urges the government to prioritize creating a conducive environment for the arts to thrive. He advocates for the integration of arts education across all regions of the country and emphasizes the need for the government to take the National Endowment Fund for the Arts seriously. Adeyemi stressed, "The government must prioritize the Endowment Fund for the arts and actively educate the public about the significance of arts."
Offering advice to emerging artists, Adeyemi encourages sincerity in their craft, hard work, and a focus on contributing positively to the nation. He emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and innovation, urging them to consider what they can offer the country rather than solely expecting support from the nation.
