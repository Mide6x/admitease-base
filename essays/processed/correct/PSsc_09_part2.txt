She stressed that any society whose families are weak can have no solid identity, no impressive institutions, and no core values. She, therefore, emphasized that it is time we recognize at all levels the importance of revamping the family structure to allow the family to regain its traditional status and its power to effect positive change in society.
The congress in Abuja organized by a coalition of non-governmental organizations, Foundation for African Cultural Heritage (FACH), which is interested in the promotion of good family values, had various speakers who spoke mainly on the need to promote good family values. The congress was a pre-congress for the World Congress of Families scheduled for early August in the Netherlands.
It aimed to encourage all stakeholders to take an interest in the traditional family formation – being the man, the woman, and the children - and do all it entails to ensure that the traditional family is structured to bring up good children who would be stable and responsible citizens, who would turn out to be the leaders of tomorrow.
It was on this note that the Executive Secretary of the Institute for Work and Family Integration, Mrs. Regina Bazuaye, stated that all the problems in society today stem from having people who were not well-formed as children, and when they grew up to become adults, they could not make good citizens. “If children were well brought up, given the proper foundation by the parents, they would grow up to be responsible citizens, adults, and parents who would also want to bring up children who are equally well brought up,” she added.
