Effect of heat processing on the proximate composition and energy values of selected Nigerian staple foods from oil-producing areas of the Niger Delta
Abstract
The proximate composition and energy values of four raw and heat-processed staple foods (yams, cassava, cocoyam, and maize) from oil-producing areas (Eleme, Ogoni, Okrika, and Nembe) of Rivers and Bayelsa States, and Abakaliki (a non-oil-producing area in Ebonyi State, Nigeria) as a control, were investigated. In raw yam tubers, moisture content was high in all locations and ranged from 61.96 ± 0.02% in Abakaliki to 63.77 ± 0.25% in Ogoni. Crude protein ranged from 1.39 ± 0.13% in Okrika to 1.71 ± 0.06% in Abakaliki, while ash content was highest (2.57 ± 0.12%) in Okrika, followed by 2.33 ± 0.01% in Eleme, and lowest (0.97 ± 0.06%) in Abakaliki. Crude fat was low in all locations, ranging from 0.10 ± 0.00% in Okrika to 0.17 ± 0.01% in Nembe, while total carbohydrate was high in all locations, ranging from 33.32 ± 0.42% in Ogoni to 35.21 ± 0.13% in Abakaliki. The calorific value (kcal/100 g sample) in all locations was low, with the highest (149.08) in yams from Abakaliki, followed by Eleme (142.55), and the lowest in Ogoni (140.09). Similar trends in values of the constituents were obtained in raw cassava, cocoyam, and maize from different oil-producing and control locations investigated. In each of these locations, heat processing generally increased the moisture content of all the samples (yam, cassava products, cocoyam, and maize), but decreased dry matter, crude protein, ash, crude fat, total carbohydrate, and calorific value. With the exception of moisture and ash, other nutrients were significantly higher in the control area of Abakaliki than the values obtained in similar samples from oil-producing areas of the Niger Delta investigated.
