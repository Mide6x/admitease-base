Microsoft will block users running counterfeit copies of Windows from installing the free Security Essentials antivirus software. All efforts, according to Microsoft, will be put in place to curb the activities of pirates. During installation, users will be asked to validate Windows running on their PC to ensure its authenticity.
However, other anti-malware companies, especially Symantec, have continued to react to the release of MSE. They believe Microsoft is not known for security and that their newly released antivirus software might not stand the test of time. Symantec referred to Security Essentials as a rehash of Windows Live OneCare, a security software from Microsoft that is now defunct.
Symantec also holds that MSE was made available for free by Microsoft due to its inferior quality and incapability to effectively combat viruses.
Regarding the rationale for offering MSE at no cost, Microsoft explained that they believe many of their customers worldwide do not have up-to-date protection either because they cannot afford it, are concerned about the impact on the performance of their PCs, or are simply unaware that their antivirus software is outdated.
The software is still available for download on the Microsoft website and other authorized websites that have the link to Microsoft.
