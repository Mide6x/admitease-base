The examples above illustrate that tonal variations in this construction are a consequence of segmentalizing the two high tones marking the future tense. The segmentation of the first high tone onto the subject noun phrase causes the inherent or lexical tone in that position to detach automatically if it is low. (This differs from the present tomorph, where segmentalization leads to the elongation of the final vowel of the subject noun phrase to accommodate the tomorph.) The second high tone of the future tense spreads to other vowel segments within the verb stem if the verb stem is not monosyllabic. Unlike the past tense tomorph, the future tense tomorph does spread. However, similar to the past tense tomorph, if the final vowel of the verb stem is omitted or becomes a glide, the tomorph must reattach, resulting in the automatic dissociation of a subsequent inherent tone. In each scenario, if the inherent tone is also high, the impact of segmentalization is inconsequential.
Negation and Interrogation
Negation in Urhobo is indicated by a floating L H tone sequence that is applied to the final vowel during phonetic realization. To accommodate this tone sequence, the final vowel is elongated, represented orthographically by doubling the final vowel. Conversely, interrogation is marked by a floating low tone on the final vowel of the statement. If the statement concludes with a low tone, adding the question morpheme creates an additional low level in the utterance. However, if the statement ends with a high tone, attaching the question morpheme generates a HL contour without lengthening the final vowel. Here are some examples:
From the above discussion, it is evident that tone serves both lexical and grammatical functions in Urhobo and is as crucial, if not more so, than the consonant and vowel segments used in speech.
