Dancing has become fashionable and even rewarding to possess more than just a superficial knowledge of dance. Whether in theory or practice, familiarity with dance can be personally fulfilling. Lecturers teaching dance in universities can attest to the complete transformation that dance has undergone.
According to him, "'Let's Dance' enlightens viewers, especially at a time when traditional values seem to be losing their appeal for many, that dance is an integral part of our cultural expression. The show has also revealed Nigerians' passion for dancing.
"'Let's Dance' provides a unique platform to showcase the richness of our culture, promoting unity while participants master their craft."
In conclusion, I urge Nigerians that we are the ones at a loss as we have relegated our culture to the background. It is only by embracing what is inherently ours that we can promote it effectively.
"Your art should serve as a marketing tool for your products. Allow me to use this analogy: Youssou N’Dour and Baaba Maal, the Senegalese musicians, wherever they go, they showcase their Senegalese culture, prompting their global fans to seek out and purchase that cultural material.
"Today, Senegalese fabrics are being sold worldwide, generating foreign exchange for their country. However, when Nigerian artists like P-Squared perform in London or New York, what aspect of our culture or products are they promoting there?
"If Tu-Face were to wear the Abeokuta Adire or the Ange of the Tiv people or another version of Ange from the Idoma people — the one with red and black stripes — to perform in Tokyo, the Japanese would begin to adopt our native fabrics due to their admiration for Tu-Face, and local fabric makers would start earning foreign currency from Tu-Face's actions. This is the transformative power that art holds for people.
"Nigeria has become a country known for jeans and t-shirts. Who popularized this trend? American artists. This foreign culture is what youths learn from television, aspiring to dress like their on-screen idols. They purchase various jeans materials, inadvertently boosting the American textile industry while undermining the Nigerian textile sector.
