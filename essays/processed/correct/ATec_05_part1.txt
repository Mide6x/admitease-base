EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF AIR LIFT PUMP
Abstract: The air lift pump has been widely used for lifting wastewater, aggressive fluids, transporting solids, and radioactive fluids in nuclear recycling plants and deep-sea mining. The performance of the air lift pump relies on fluid and geometric properties. This study conducted experiments with a model air lift pump to determine these parameters and their impact on performance. Subsequently, Lift Dimensionless Number (LDN) and Pump Dimensionless Number (PDN) were developed to encompass all flow parameters. By analyzing the experimental data, a logarithmic plot of the dimensionless numbers was created to establish a relationship between them. It was observed that air lift pumps with smaller riser pipe diameters achieved higher lifts. Additionally, fluids with better adhesive properties, such as water, resulted in higher lifts. The study also found that lift increased with greater submergence under all injection pressures for various fluids and fluid-solid mixtures. A logarithmic plot of LDN against PDN revealed a slope of 0.22 and an intercept of -0.78. This research successfully generated dimensionless parameters for characterizing the air lift pump.
