Ajose recounted a visit to Michigan, USA, in October 1996, for an African World Expo where he met Mayor Gary Loster and was introduced to Marlon Jackson. It wasn't until last year when Marlon Jackson visited the slave route on March 7, 2008, that he expressed a deep connection to the place. Through consultations with the Ifa Oracle, it was revealed that the Jackson family indeed hailed from Badagry, specifically from an Ajaneson family of Vothun Priest lineage.
Based on Marlon's strong sense of déjà vu and the Ifa divinations, the 2009 ceremony, sponsored by various organizations, will take place. The theme for this year's celebration is 'Family Reunion', featuring picnics, symposia, speeches, dramas, a candlelight procession, Vothun Festival, African Arts exhibition, Zamgbetto Festival, Boat Regatta, and the final burial rites for Michael Jackson.
For the burial rites, Chief Zannu Awhanvoyetho, a chief priest of Vothun, stated that a portion of Jackson's earth would be brought to Badagry for interment. Other rituals will follow, with permission granted by the Jackson family.
The Motherland Group has initiated the construction of a museum to house Michael Jackson's memorabilia.
