The air lift pump has been utilized for many years to lift wastewater, aggressive fluids, transport solid mixtures, and handle radioactive fluids in nuclear recycling plants (Weber, 1982). It is also suitable for deep-sea applications, provided that the impact of air expansion at the inlet on efficiency and lifting power is not overly detrimental. Brege et al. (1990) reported the use of air lift pumps for sampling Juvenile Salmons. The diverse applications and varying plant sizes necessitate a scientific foundation to ensure optimal performance in each specific case. Consequently, numerous efforts have been made to comprehensively characterize the air lift pump. Versluys (1931) was among the first to propose a general theory, and subsequent theories have been developed. Notable experimental investigations include Heywood et al. (1981) studying air lift pumping of shear-thinning suspensions, Nigel et al. (1981) attempting a similar study, and Wurts et al. (1994) determining pumping capacities for floating air lift pumps powered by centrifugal blowers. Additionally, Francis (1996) developed a physical model to calculate the air flow rate needed to pump a specific water flow rate in a well designed for in-well air stripping of volatile organic compounds from an aquifer. Kumar et al. (2003) conducted an experimental study on air lift pumps with tapered up-riser pipes, reporting improved performance with tapered riser pipes. Hitoshi Fujimoto et al. (2003) investigated the pump performance of a small air-lift system for conveying solid particles. Various numerical approaches have been attempted, such as Weber (1982) simulating vertical solid conveying and Nenes et al. (1996) using an integral model to simulate air lift pumps for moderately deep water wells, with results closely matching experimental data. This research aims to establish dimensionless relationships from experiments to characterize the air lift pump.
