The present tense in Urhobo serves to convey habitual, present, or continuous actions. The tense is marked by a floating high tone that appears at the end of the subject noun phrase. To manifest this tomorph, the final vowel of the subject noun phrase is slightly prolonged. If the subject noun phrase already ends with a high tone, both the high tone and the final vowel are perceptibly lengthened. However, if the subject noun phrase ends with a low tone, the present tense tomorph is segmented onto the elongated part of the final vowel. As mentioned earlier, when the subject pronoun or verb lacks a tomorph, it is articulated with a low tone. Consequently, in the case of a pronoun as the subject noun phrase, the initial part of the vowel carries a low tone while the elongated portion bears the high tone. Let us examine some examples. (Note: pr.t= present tomorph.)
The Past Tense
In the full form of the past tense, the verb is supplemented with a suffix that appears in two phonological forms depending on the vowel harmony requirements of the verb stem vowel. The vowels in Urhobo fall into two groups based on vowel harmony, with the Advanced Tongue Root [ATR] being the harmony feature. Vowels such as /i, e, o, u/ are [+ATR], whereas /แบน, a, o/ are [-ATR]. The two forms of the verb suffix are -ri and -re. If the verb stem vowel is [+ATR], it takes the suffix -ri; if the verb stem is [-ATR], it takes -re. This suffix is only present when the verb is not followed by an object; if an object follows, the suffix is omitted.
