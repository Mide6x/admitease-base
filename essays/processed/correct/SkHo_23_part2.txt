You can purchase suits at various shopping centers nationwide. The local market offers more competitive prices due to better bargaining power. Suits at most malls start from N25,000. Vendors offering lower prices often claim it as a promotional deal. With good negotiation skills, you can find quality suits for even less at certain markets.
The Essential Four:
• The Standard Blue:
Ideal for business meetings, lunches, dinners, or casual gatherings. It pairs well with black or brown shoes and can even be daringly styled with white. It looks exceptional by a pool. Opt for a navy shade without veering towards lighter hues.
• The Classic Gray:
Suitable for all occasions and can even make a red-headed individual look dapper. Gray suits work well with patterns, especially those in the chevron family. Start with plain designs and progress to window-pane patterns. Gray suits are never controversial; they are the epitome of versatility.
• The Basic Black:
A timeless favorite suitable for events like the Oscars or your sister's wedding. It complements a crisp white shirt perfectly and is adored by professionals, fashion designers, and even undertakers (professions that demand a keen fashion sense encompassing respectability, assertiveness, vanity, and sagacity). If you were to own just one suit, let it be black. You can even be laid to rest in it.
• Any of the above options with pinstripes.
