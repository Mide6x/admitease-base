Your Path to Success and Wealth
By now, I am sure that we are all aware of our financial health and no longer wrongly assume that the future will take care of itself (faith without works???).
In the last edition, we focused on two major points:
(a) The need to identify your heart's desire, that is knowing exactly what you really want, and;
(b) The need to personalize that desire to suit your circumstances.
Having settled that, the next step will be to determine exactly where you are - Your true financial situation, not what you think you have or what you hope to have. So, I suggest you start by asking yourself the following questions:
- What are your income, lifestyle, and equity goals?
- Is there any way you can streamline your spending to fit into your budget?
- Where did your money go, and how can you increase your wealth?
- Are there strategies for generating new sources of wealth?
- How do you quit your unnecessary spending habits that inevitably lead you into debt?
- How do you develop the habit of saving in order to achieve financial freedom?
TIME TO TAKE STOCK
Now, write down the following: your present earnings, how much money you have in the bank (if any), your debt profile, your net worth, and more particularly, your expenses on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. If you are not happy with the result of this stock-taking, then it is time to seriously consider how best to move from your financial struggle to financial freedom.
SO, WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM?
I told you in the previous edition that there are a lot of ways to get rich, which include: chance, speculation, inheritance, theft, extortion, contract scams, counterfeiting, 419, kidnapping, etc. But I also said that MoneySense is only interested in ONE WAY: The Legitimate Way.
