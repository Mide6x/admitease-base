To be a good dad, we must learn to control our emotions, one of which is anger. Our children will sometimes provoke us, but reacting with anger or violence towards them won’t help them grow up as emotionally stable individuals. Screaming at them isn’t an effective form of communication either. Have you noticed that when you tell your children to do things out of anger, they often don't do it well? Their minds seem to shut down when they are yelled at. The old-fashioned method of physical punishment for every mistake is also not effective when done out of anger instead of love. Another emotion that must be managed is love that doesn’t allow for correction. You should never love your children to the point that they become unruly; you should allow space for them to be corrected.
To be a good father, we must let their mother have her say. In the past, it was common to find fathers scolding mothers in front of the children. Sometimes, it’s because mothers ‘overreacted’ to the children's misbehavior. In such families where this is common, you will often find the indulged children eventually becoming a burden to the parents (both father and mother).
I believe that when it comes to raising our children, we must respect their mothers’ opinions. I heard my wife say to my son once, ‘don’t drink that juice yet, it’s too early to have it.’ A few minutes later, he came to me with pleading eyes, hoping I would overturn his mother's decision. I was tempted, but I said NO. If you think their mother is too strict, then discuss it with her later when the children are not around to express your feelings.
