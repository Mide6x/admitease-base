Ambiguity is another problem encountered in the analysis of meaning in natural languages. Ambiguous words or utterances can be interpreted in various ways depending on the linguistic context. For example, the expression "she is nice" can have different interpretations. The word "nice" could mean "caring, kind, accommodating, beautiful," or other virtues. Another aspect of ambiguity arises when an utterance requires a true or false response that may not always be definitive. Lyons (1977: 169) notes: "If there is a possible world in which a sentence is both true and false, we can say that the sentence expresses two distinct propositions."
Another problem in meaning analysis is that concepts that do not exist for a particular person or group may not be present in their speech and may lack a name or meaning for them (Udofot 2004: 136). This implies that objects referred to in speech only have meaning when they are within the knowledge of the speaker or hearer. If such objects are mentioned outside the knowledge of the listener(s), it poses a serious problem for analysis.
Similarly, the absence of shared knowledge, beliefs, conventions, and presuppositions between the speaker and the hearer can present a significant challenge in the analysis of the meaning of a given utterance. The presence of these contextual features is crucial for interpreting an utterance correctly.
Subjectivity and introspection of concepts also pose challenges in obtaining objective meanings of words and utterances if everyone must delve into their own minds. Haas (1973: 20) states that "an empirical science like linguistics cannot rely on a procedure of looking into their minds; each into his own." Some theories define meaning in terms of "symbol-image-referent relationships," which only apply to concrete things, not abstractions. For instance, mental images of concepts like liberty, air, or courage cannot be visualized.
