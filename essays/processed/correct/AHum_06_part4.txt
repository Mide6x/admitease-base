Regarding tonal changes, the past tense construction introduces a high tomorph, which is segmented onto the sole vowel segment of a monosyllabic verb stem or the final vowel of a disyllabic verb stem. When a verb stem is accompanied by a noun object, the final vowel of the verb stem is either omitted or forms a glide, leading to the past tense tomorph being detached. As a grammatical tone, it must reconnect with the prefix vowel of the subsequent noun object, causing the dissociation of the lexical tone in that position if it is low. However, if the tone is high, it merges with the high tomorph, rendering the reconnection effect void. Let us consider some examples:
The Future Tense
The complete form of the future tense is marked segmentally by a particle positioned between the subject noun phrase and the verb stem of the clause. This particle manifests in two phonological forms, /che/ and /cha/, depending on the vowel harmony requirement of the verb stem vowel. If the verb stem vowel is [-(-ART], it selects /che/; if it is [-ART], it selects /cha/. The future tense signifies an action that is yet to commence or one that is being contemplated.
Tonally, the future tense construction features a H - L - H tone sequence distributed as follows:
a) the initial high tone is segmented onto the final vowel of the subject noun phrase (or the sole vowel segment of a monosyllabic subject pronoun).
b) the low tone is assigned to the future tense particle.
c) the second high tone is allocated to the first vowel of the verb stem and extends to any subsequent vowel segments within the verb stem, resulting in all verb stem vowels being articulated as high. Let us consider some examples:
