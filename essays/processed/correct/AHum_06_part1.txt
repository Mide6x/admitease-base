Grammatical Tones
Grammatical tones are tones that have grammatical significance and, within the autosegmental framework of generative phonology, they exist independently of 'segmental' phonological strings. They are assigned to specific positions in grammatical constructions where they play a role in the tonal output of the strings in their surface form. Tone plays a significant role in the grammar of Urhobo as most of the grammatical information is conveyed through the manipulation of tones. For example, tense and aspectual information are often indicated by tones. The segmentation of these grammatical tones usually leads to modifications in the lexical tones carried by neighboring segments.
Tone in the Associative Noun Phrase
The associative construction, also known as the Noun + Noun phrase, is marked by the morpheme /re/ which carries a high tone and is positioned between the two nouns. In normal speech, the vowel of this associative marker is consistently omitted, but its high tone persists and is transferred onto the prefix vowel of the following noun, resulting in tonal changes on the second noun.
From the examples provided, it is evident that while the first nouns in each phrase maintain their lexical tones, the prefix vowels of the second nouns all adopt the high tone imparted by the associative marker. Consequently, in examples 6(a), (b), and (d), where the second nouns originally start with a low tone in their citation form, they become high due to the high tone of the associative marker transferring onto their prefix vowel. Thus, a tonal shift from low to high occurs. In example 6(c), where the second noun already carries a high tone, no tonal modification occurs as the two high tones simply merge into one.
