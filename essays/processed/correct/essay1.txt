Education is one of the most important things that can happen to a person. In Nigeria, many students do not attend school due to poverty. The government must address this issue urgently. Without education, our nation's future is at risk. I urge policymakers to allocate resources toward building more schools and subsidizing tuition fees. For instance, my brother James had to discontinue his education last year because our father could no longer afford the costs.
