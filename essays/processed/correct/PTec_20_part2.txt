The physical layer and architecture of the standard were approved by ITU-T Study Group 15 on October 9. The data link layer is expected to receive final approval at the group's meeting in May 2010.
The Home Grid Forum, in collaboration with the Broadband Forum, is working on a certification program to assist semiconductor and systems manufacturers in producing standards-compliant products. Products meeting the G.hn standard will bear the HomeGrid-certified logo.
At the recent ITU-T Study Group 15 meeting, a new standard focusing on the coexistence of G.hn-based products with other technologies was agreed upon. Known as G.9972, this standard outlines how G.hn devices will interact with power line devices using technologies like IEEE P1901. Additionally, there are plans to extend G.hn to support SmartGrid applications.
