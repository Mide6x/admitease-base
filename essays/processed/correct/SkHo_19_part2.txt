Consider establishing a Practice Group Leaders Council to enhance communication and knowledge-sharing among departments, practice groups, and industry teams. These councils typically meet quarterly to review activities and facilitate information flow throughout the firm.
During meetings with practice leaders, celebrate small successes, encourage hesitant leaders to take action, and address cross-cutting issues that may impact multiple practice groups. Conduct biannual progress reviews with all practice leaders to evaluate their advancements, provide feedback on action plans, and suggest strategies for improvement. By scheduling these reviews in advance, you underscore the significance of accountability and tangible results.
