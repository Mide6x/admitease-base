• Hypospadias:
This disorder involves the urethra opening on the underside of the penis, rather than at the tip.
• Phimosis:
Common in newborns and young children, phimosis is the tightness of the penile foreskin, which typically resolves without treatment. Circumcision may be recommended if it interferes with urination.
• Paraphimosis:
When an uncircumcised boy’s penis is retracted but fails to return to its original position, blood flow to the penis head may be compromised, causing pain and swelling. Lubrication or circumcision may be recommended by a doctor.
• Ambiguous genitalia:
This condition occurs when a child is born with ambiguous genitalia that are not clearly male or female. In most cases in boys, the penis may be underdeveloped or absent, while testicular tissue is present. In rare instances, the child may have both testicular and ovarian tissue.
• Micropenis:
This disorder involves a penis that is normally formed but significantly smaller than average based on standard measurements.
