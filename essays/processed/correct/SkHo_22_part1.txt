How to Nurture Customer Relationships During a Meltdown
Step One: Decide that you want to have more fun in your job
Traditional wisdom states that the purpose of improving customer relationships is to increase sales to those customers. However, while higher sales figures are a natural result of better customer relationships, the true reason for fostering better customer relationships is to make the process of selling more enjoyable and rewarding. Consider this: wouldn't you prefer to spend time with people you like and who reciprocate that feeling, rather than trying to manipulate people into purchasing things they may not want or need? Engaging with people, learning about their lives, is inherently interesting and fun, as long as your intention in building relationships is not self-serving. From this perspective, selling becomes a way to assist the person with whom you have a strong business relationship, rather than an end in itself.
Step Two: Be someone who attracts good customer relationships
Customers choose to build relationships with sales representatives who embody four key attributes:
1. Professionalism: There is a significant contrast between professionals and amateurs. People prefer engaging with individuals who take their work seriously and are willing to invest time in gaining a deep understanding of their field. Enhancing your level of professionalism can be achieved by reading industry trade journals that enhance your business acumen.
2. Integrity: Integrity means being true to your word. When you commit to something, your customers trust that you will follow through. Integrity is also displayed when you stand firm, even when your stance may not align with your customer or company. It's not about being confrontational but having the courage to make decisions based on what you know is right.
3. Empathy: People value relationships with those who genuinely care about them. Demonstrating care for a customer involves actively listening to what they have to say.
4. Knowledge: People respect those with unique knowledge. This doesn't mean you need to be an expert on every product or service you sell, but possessing valuable knowledge for the customer is essential.
