Adeyemi’s Art Odyssey
He aspired to become a medical doctor, a profession treasured by his father who hoped he would pursue it. However, fate had other plans for him, and today, he is content with embracing a career that ignites his passion. Meet Kunle Adeyemi, an art scholar and an authority in printmaking and painting. Adeyemi’s profound love for the arts is evident, leading to his widespread recognition for his significant contributions to the industry. After 25 years of professional practice, this esteemed artist shows no signs of slowing down but instead aims to further propel the industry forward.
Turning fifty is often seen as a significant milestone warranting celebration. Adeyemi, however, opted for a distinctive form of celebration by hosting an exhibition to showcase his creative works accumulated over the years.
For him, marking his birthday with an exhibition is not only a milestone but also a moment of gratitude towards God. According to Adeyemi, "As an art scholar, reaching fifty years of age, which this exhibition commemorates, is a significant milestone, especially when one considers entering the second half of life, following the biblical lifespan of three score and ten."
The solo exhibition, commencing today at the Quintessence gallery in Ikoyi, undoubtedly unveils the creative brilliance inherent in Adeyemi’s works, influenced by his thoughts and cultural environment.
With over 13 solo exhibitions and more than 30 group exhibitions, both locally and internationally, this exhibition highlights the artist's close connection with nature and his documentation of unfolding events.
His recent workshop and exhibition in Sweden have positively influenced his style, leading to the creation of new and distinctive works. His pieces incorporate deep etching, serigraphy, and are influenced by his Yoruba heritage.
