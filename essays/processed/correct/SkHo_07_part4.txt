Bacteria also love the warm and moist genital areas. These areas are too sensitive for alcohol. The feminine areas should be cleaned during bathing and washed with soap. Scrubbing of the delicate skin can lead to damage. Scrubbing is helpful in removing dead skin and cleaving bacteria from the anal and scrotal regions. A little disinfectant in bathing water is helpful for antibacterial protection of the genital areas. For most parts of the body, keeping bacteria low also keeps fungi at bay as fungi are often opportunistic, capitalizing on areas where bacteria have invaded and lowered the body’s defenses.
Underwear should be changed as needed, and in the tropics, cotton material (rather than synthetics) is useful for good body ventilation and for easily soaking up sweat and allowing it to be evaporated. Underwear should not be reused before washing. These habits limit our vulnerability to genital disease-causing organisms that can be picked up in public facilities. Even the air in these areas can be loaded with microbial spores. There is no real danger if we have hygienic habits because these microbes won’t have a chance to thrive on our bodies.
