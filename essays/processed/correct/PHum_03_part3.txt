"Stations like AIT possess some of this infrastructure. What I am stressing is the importance of taking action. They focus on other areas. Isn't this the same issue we have with Globacom and other telecom companies? Have you ever seen Globacom sponsoring a dance contest or a theater production? No, they are largely focused on sports, neglecting the growth of the cultural industry.
"If Mnet, a non-Nigerian company, is willing to go the extra mile, then our local television stations should also consider investing in such initiatives. They might even do it better than the foreign stations are currently doing," he added.
He emphasized that "the essence of what we define as culture is encapsulated in the art of dance. Dance communicates every aspect of our human lives and, when combined with oral tradition and oral poetry, serves as a tool to transmit tradition and culture from one generation to another. Therefore, besides the economic potential of dance, it is an art form that one can engage in for a lifetime.
"Dance is an integral part of art; flexibility is not just a crucial part of dance but also of the entire dance program. Regardless of your level of involvement in dance — whether major, minor, or as a part-time enthusiast — you can choreograph your own dance steps."
"Let's Dance" represents a profound exploration of Nigerian culture. It offers a unique platform to showcase the richness of our culture, providing an opportunity for dancing couples to immerse themselves in diverse musical cultures while honing their own.
"The audience learned valuable lessons through 'Let's Dance.' Firstly, every dance carries a thematic focus. Secondly, dance is an amalgamation of styles. Thirdly, the love for song and dance is universal across all Nigerian tribes. Fourthly, always put your best foot forward in dance. Fifthly, when dancing, remember to blend good characterization with a high level of carriage. In essence, 'Let's Dance' offers holistic entertainment for Nigerians," he stated.
