The feet need daily scrubbing. The nails need occasional pedicures to remove dirt, bacteria, and fungus under and around the nails. Occasionally (once a month), the feet should be soaked in water with added disinfectant for 10-30 minutes. This soaking kills bacteria hiding in areas not reached by daily scrubbing. It also softens calloused skin, which can be removed by gentle scraping. If this is not done, the microbes react with sweat and dead skin, creating a pungent odor. Shoes should be aired out when taken off. The insides of shoes should be cleaned regularly with a damp soapy cloth and followed by a disinfectant. Avoid transferring dirt and bacteria from the exterior to the interior of shoes when cleaning them. Different cleaning cloths should be used for the outside and the inside. Shoes can also be conditioned by placing them under the hot sun after cleaning. Avoid wearing closed shoes all the time in the tropics. Alternate covered shoes with ventilated footwear.
Finally, the home environment, if not well cleaned and disinfected, can harbor bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that cover the surfaces we touch, and their spores fill the air that we breathe.
These means for good health are accessible to all because they are easy and inexpensive.
