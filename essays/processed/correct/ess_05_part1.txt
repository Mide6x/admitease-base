INTRODUCTION
The study of meaning is a challenging exercise. Meaning has been viewed as the most elusive and controversial phenomenon in language study. Its vague nature allows for diverse interpretations depending on the speaker, the hearer, and the situation. Philosophers, anthropologists, and linguists have attempted to provide solutions to the unstable and ambiguous nature of meaning but have not been successful. Due to the complexity of meaning, several problems are associated with its analysis in natural languages. Various theories of meaning have been proposed to tackle these issues. This paper aims to discuss some of the problems linked to the analysis of meaning and a current theory that reasonably addresses these problems.
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANALYSIS OF MEANING IN NATURAL LANGUAGES
There are particular problems related to the analysis of meaning in natural languages. Some of these problems are discussed below. The problem of graded boundaries poses a challenge to the proper analysis of meaning in natural languages. Jackendoff (1996), cited in Udofot (2004: 140), observes:
"In talking about the color 'red' in English, one is faced with a broad range of hues from orange to lavender, creating difficulties in distinguishing where orange ends and lavender begins."
According to her, there are borderline cases where a particular color can be perceived as red, orange, or lavender depending on the context. Similar issues exist with words like "fat": What defines the lower boundary of a fat woman? At what point can a woman be described as thin, medium, or fat? These questions are relevant to the problem of graded boundaries.
