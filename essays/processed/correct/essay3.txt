I am applying for the Computer Science program to leverage my passion for coding and problem-solving. Notably, I developed a inventory management application to streamline operations at my motherâ€™s retail business. I am confident in my ability to excel academically, as evidenced by my strong WAEC results. While my mathematics score was impacted by inconsistent teacher availability, I have since taken online courses to strengthen this skillset.
