"Optic Fiber Vs Wireless" by Chris Uwaje, with contribution from Roland Alden. However, in developing economies where network construction is seen as an investment in the economy and a driver of economic growth, this perspective is out of sync. Network construction in these environments should be optimized to maximize opportunities along and adjacent to the network route. For instance, in the cost-oriented model of network construction, the requirement for reliable electricity at a regeneration point is considered a negative factor that needs to be addressed either through expensive construction or sophisticated electronics that enable uninterrupted passage through powerless regions.
In the development model, providing electricity and infrastructure along the network route is viewed as an opportunity to foster an economic environment that attracts network customers in the long term. Additionally, investing in a micro-economy reduces the cost of providing services to potentially larger economies connected to the network. This approach to network construction is not common in the telecommunications industry but is standard practice in other networks, such as roads and water systems.
In many large countries, it is common to travel on long, sparsely populated highways and encounter gas stations at regular intervals, fueling economic activity along the highway. Special vehicles with massive fuel tanks are not necessary because of the presence of these gas stations. Typically, a small economy may develop around a gas station, sustaining it and potentially expanding to include mechanized farms, irrigation systems, a small airport, and a regional healthcare facility. The strategic location of a gas station at the intersection of two highways can double its value to the surrounding economies it supports compared to being alongside just one highway.
By examining this example, it is evident that the topology of trade routes and human settlements influences infrastructure development significantly. Telecommunications development aligns with these patterns to a certain extent but has been distorted by two external factors: regulations and the use of technology to bypass obstacles in communication.
