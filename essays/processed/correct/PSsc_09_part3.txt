Bazuaye mentioned that FACH is trying to make everyone awaken to the responsibility of engendering good family values and noted that the impressive turnout and interactive session at the Abuja congress went a long way to show that people are really keen on promoting good family values. “What we have decided to do, either through individual NGO levels or under FACH, is to keep carrying out various activities that would help in promoting laws that would also help to keep the family firmly rooted as it fights against things that are anti-family,” she added.
FACH, Bazuaye said, is also concerned about how Nigerians came about children that are drug addicts and street kids. This, she noted, was because the parents have fallen short of their responsibilities in the pursuit of wealth. “We want people to know that you have to work to earn a living, but you don’t have to spend all your time working. You have to also have time for your family and also be in a position to play your primary role because you cannot assign your God-given task to someone who has no interest in whether your child turns out right or wrong.
For example, if you work 18 hours of the day, which means you left home while your children were sleeping and then come back when they are in bed, you would make all the money, fly them all over the world, and do whatever they desire, “but then you would not even know your children because you do not have time to interact with them, know them, and form them. You only leave them at the mercies of drivers, house helps, and cooks. You have to be there for your children right from day one and try to make friends with them.”
She, therefore, said that the coalition of NGOs was out to promote work and family balance and family enrichment - what you need to know and what you must do to bring proper upbringing to your children so that they would come out right.
