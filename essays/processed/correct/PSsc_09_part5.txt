The negligence of grooming children in the right way, Bazuaye stressed further, has a negative effect on the national economy. She was of the view that if society has good citizens, bribery and corruption would not exist, noting, “If a child is brought up to know what is right from what is wrong, he would not go wrong. When you buy exam questions for your children, you are more or less encouraging corruption in the system. So everything stems from the parents because if the parents show good examples to the children by the way they conduct themselves, the children would turn out to be like their parents whom they have seen living in particular ways.”
Bazuaye, a social scientist by training, who studied industrial administration at the University of Sawford, UK, and also has a postgraduate diploma in business administration from Sheffield University, UK, and has had various working experiences all around Nigeria in the ministry, media, and non-governmental organizations, is particularly concerned about mothers playing their parental roles more than any other person.
She stressed that though a woman needs to work to support the income of the husband, especially at this period, she must not lose focus on her primary assignment as a parent. “For me, I believe that the upbringing of my children is my sole responsibility and not somebody else’s. So no matter what I do, I try to make sure that I do my bit, and I think every mother has to live up to that responsibility, no matter what work you are doing.
