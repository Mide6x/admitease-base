"We take pride in pioneering this initiative in Nigeria, maintaining our leadership in the retail market with innovative products and services."
Oando Marketing recently introduced another customer-centric initiative, Oando Pay-As-U-Gas, which involves dispensing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) into customers' cylinders using a metered pump directly at the station forecourt.
The benefits of the Pay-As-U-Gas service to customers include flexibility, product integrity, convenience, expert after-sales service, and the ability for customers to retain physical possession of their cylinders. This service is currently available at selected service stations in Lagos, Abuja, and Kaduna.
"Oando Marketing Limited is the leading oil retailer in the nation, with one out of every five liters of petroleum products sold or distributed through Oando's extensive network of over 500 retail outlets and strategically positioned terminals. This ensures continuous product supply and availability in Nigeria and the West African sub-region, including Ghana, Togo, and Benin," the statement concluded.
