Dr. Saka Jimoh from the University of Ibadan (UI), representing Professor Musiliu Onilude from the Department of Agricultural Engineering, stressed that tree planting should not solely rely on government initiatives. Jimoh demonstrated the proper tree planting techniques to participants and introduced two species for planting - the Terminalia Montalis suitable for open fields and house fronts, and the Queens Palm recommended for road medians due to its shallow roots that do not disrupt underground cables.
Mrs. Kemi Nelson, an Action Congress (AC) Leader in the state, encouraged campaign participants to cherish and nurture the trees they plant, expressing the importance of showing care and dedication to environmental preservation.
