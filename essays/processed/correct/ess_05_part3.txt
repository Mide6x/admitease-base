Moreover, the diversity of ideas individuals hold about things presents a challenge in meaning analysis. Udofot (2004) suggests that "a well-described picture can be perceived differently by different people depending on their intellectual capacities, power of imagination, and backgrounds" (p. 62). People may interpret things differently based on their experiences and perspectives.
Furthermore, not all concepts are observable, which complicates meaning analysis. Abstract nouns, for instance, are not tangible. Explaining a word like "nice" by using terms like beautiful, handsome, or charming assumes that the hearer already understands the meanings of these words stored in their mind.
Interpreting meaning solely based on the visual image conjured by the hearer is another limitation in meaning analysis. While visualizing objects like a hen or duck might provide a simple distinction, scientifically describing differences using terms like "long neck" is more accurate.
Additionally, propositions can vary based on the time and place of utterance, as every utterance occurs within a specific spatio-temporal context. Lack of knowledge of these contextual elements can impede meaningful analysis.
Lastly, many expressions in natural languages do not have single referents, leading to potential ambiguities. For example, the expression "that young man is my brother" may require consideration of the speaker's identity and the reference's relationship. Understanding the extent of the relationship between the speaker and the referent can be challenging.
A CURRENT THEORY ADDRESSING THESE PROBLEMS
A recommended current theory that reasonably addresses the aforementioned problems associated with the analysis of meaning in natural languages is pragmatics. According to Levinson (1983: 24), pragmatics is the "ability of language users to pair sentences with the context in which they would be appropriate." Pragmatics offers a user-centered description of language.
Pragmatics theory enables the interpretation not only of the literal meaning of an utterance but also the nuances derived from formality and politeness. It incorporates the context, culture, deixis, presuppositions, implicatures, and paralinguistic features in understanding meaning. Pragmatics provides a comprehensive analysis that considers both observable and unobservable aspects of language events, reflecting the choices and constraints language users encounter in social interactions.
