The majority of these maternal deaths are not only preventable but also needless. A report by the Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) and the Center for Reproductive Rights sheds light on the Nigerian government's accountability for the dire state of maternal health in the country. Titled "Broken Promise: Human Rights, Accountability & Maternal Deaths in Nigeria," the report delves into the key factors contributing to Nigeria's high maternal mortality rate and the associated human rights and legal implications. It highlights governmental failures in leadership, healthcare financing, corruption, limited contraceptive access, and funding as key drivers of the high maternal death rate.
While the Nigerian government has acknowledged maternal mortality as a critical issue and enacted laws and policies in response, the report underscores that these efforts have not translated into substantial improvements in maternal health nationwide. Numerous factors hinder the provision and accessibility of maternal healthcare in Nigeria, including inadequate implementation of laws and policies, systemic corruption, deficient infrastructure, ineffective healthcare services, and limited access to skilled healthcare providers exacerbated by fragmented healthcare responsibilities among the government's three tiers.
The absence of a constitutional or legal framework delineating healthcare responsibilities is identified as the root cause of a dysfunctional healthcare system where all levels of government have failed to prioritize healthcare duties, particularly concerning maternal care. Challenges surrounding resource allocation for healthcare further compound the issue.
The WARDC report emphasizes that "most of these deaths can be prevented. Preventable maternal death and disability are increasingly recognized as pressing human rights issues, involving questions of resource allocation and political commitment for which governments must be held accountable." This underscores the crucial role of government accountability in effectively curbing maternal mortality.
