During today's exhibition opening, Adeyemi will showcase over 35 works, including pieces like Ancestral Mask, Wheel of Fortune, Bountiful Harvest, Praise God, Fragment of Tradition, and the Village Square, among others. The Mask of Honour symbolizes how masks serve as a window through which the world perceives Africa. Adeyemi explains that the concept of masks embodies festivity and celebration, stating, "These works were crafted to document African traditions for future generations." He further elaborated that Fragment of Tradition aims to depict the recognition of elders in society.
During a preview of the exhibition last week, Adeyemi revealed that the exhibition holds significance as it provides a platform for him to translate his thoughts and perceptions into a vision of what art should represent.
Culture and environment play pivotal roles in Adeyemiâ€™s works, as he believes that reflecting on culture and past experiences, coupled with a constant pursuit of new ideas, has resulted in a fruitful creative journey. He expressed, "My works reflect my passion for exploring the world around me artistically. The current phase of my work is characterized by semi-abstraction, with images becoming more intricate through the incorporation of various elements, rendering my recent works more qualitative in thematic, stylistic, and formal presentation."
Adeyemi, who received mentorship from distinguished art masters such as Professor Yusuf Grillo, Bruce Onabrakpeya, S. I Wagboje, Dan Ikhu Omovbude, and Dr. Fowowe, has been lauded by friends and colleagues as a bridge builder, attentive listener, and highly creative artist. Oshin Ademola from the National Gallery of Art, Lagos, likened Adeyemi's skills to those of the masters, attributing the dynamic changes in art styles to his unquenchable thirst for knowledge.
A notable trait attributed to Adeyemi by many art enthusiasts is his philanthropic spirit. Moses Ohiomokhare, the Curator of Quintessence gallery, commended his philanthropy, citing his donation of several works to the Federal Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, after an exhibition two years ago. Ohiomokhare further mentioned that to mark his fiftieth birthday this year, Adeyemi plans to offer scholarships to students and launch his book.
