MWEB Nigeria's Network Operations Center (NOC) has an inbuilt Adaptive Coding Modulation (ACM) on the outbound channel to allow it to gain significant bandwidth efficiencies and provide high availability services, especially during unfavorable weather conditions. Once MWEB's NOC senses a signal degradation on the modem, it sends more power to the modem automatically to prevent a loss of connection, ensuring that MWEB's clients can still work optimally during rainstorms, providing customers with unsurpassed network connectivity throughout the day.
MWEB Nigeria's General Manager, John Ugbe, said, "Customers can now receive incoming calls from any voice network, including fixed telephone lines and GSM lines. This will also enable our business customers to send facsimile (fax) documents using conventional fax equipment on the iWay VoIP line, making business operations smoother. Each line activated on iWayVAP (voice appliance) will be assigned a number, and all calls originated from iWayVAP will display the caller's identity to enable customers to see beforehand who is calling them," he concluded.
