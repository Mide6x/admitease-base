Step Three: Align your thoughts and behaviors to consistently build trust
Building customer relationships not only depends on who you are but also on your thoughts about yourself, customers, and the sales process. Ideally, all three should be aligned and congruent. Here's how:
1. Cultivate the right mindset: To have others value a relationship with you, you must genuinely believe that relationship-building is crucial and that you have something valuable to offer.
2. Be curious about people: People are attracted to those who show genuine interest in them. Curiosity about others is vital for relationship-building, offering opportunities to learn and establish connections.
3. Maintain consistency in your actions: A customer's trust in you, and willingness to form a relationship, relies on demonstrating consistent and reliable behavior over time. When a customer can anticipate your actions, they are more likely to trust you.
Step Four: Approach meetings as opportunities to build relationships
Every customer meeting is a chance to develop or strengthen the relationship, with the messenger (you) being more important than the message (what you say). Rather than a sales pitch, a customer meeting should focus on finding ways for both you and the customer to help each other succeed. To achieve this, follow these touchstones:
1. Seek the truth: Ensure the meeting is aimed at understanding how you can genuinely assist the customer. Customers recognize honesty when you are willing to address potential shortcomings in your product or company.
2. Maintain an open mind: Entering a meeting convinced that the customer needs your product can lead to a closed-minded approach. Being open to the possibility that the customer may be better served elsewhere shows a dedication to their best interests.
3. Foster genuine dialogue: A customer meeting should involve a two-way conversation, not just a sales pitch. Listening to the customer for at least half of the meeting time, engaging in substantive discussions on business matters, not just casual conversation, is key.
