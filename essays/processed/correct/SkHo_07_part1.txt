Controlling Body Odor
You step out of your place in the queue at your bank. You had thought you would put up with it, but your resistance breaks down. The woman in front of you and the man behind you have something in common. They have not been kind to their own armpits.
You had planned for a two-hour stretch in the library, and you were tucked into your books. Suddenly, there is a bad odor. You look under the table, and the handsome guy across from you had slipped off his shoes. Goodbye to the library. Your colleague is enthusiastically explaining the circulated memo to you at close range, and you shut her up quickly! You are nagging your driver despite his petting you with "Mummy," "Madam," and a thousand "Ma." The truth is you hate being sealed up in your car's air conditioning with his body odor. In the quiet of your sitting room, you initiated an impromptu dance with your girlfriend. You cut it off sooner than expected because her hair was not fresh.
Body odor (B.O.) is an unpleasant smell from the body. It is irritating, repulsive, and can make people spiteful towards the bearer. It is caused by secreted body fluids and bacterial action, especially problematic in tropical areas where bacterial action can be rapid. Refinement is not a privilege of the rich and educated. It does require some effort but is not necessarily expensive. Everyone - from cleaners and market women to university professors and business magnates, young and old, illiterate and educated, rich and poor - can enjoy personal refinement without much cost.
Refinement helps us to have good relationships with others. When we lack refinement, it can bring out the worst in people (though a virtuous person would show tolerance and kindness towards everyone despite their lack of refinement).
