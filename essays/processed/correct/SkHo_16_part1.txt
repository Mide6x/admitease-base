How to be a good father to your children
Comments by some children about their father are disheartening. You will hear them talk about the head of the home as someone who hasn’t been there for them. A father who is never around; a good man to everyone but his own. To some children, daddy is the greatest. He buys whatever they ask for, and pampers them with gifts. He saves them from mummy’s punishment. That daddy will always be on my side is the confidence some children have.
I counseled a lady recently who was concerned about her children’s behavior. They seem to be acting out more each day, and she’s losing control over them; thanks to their dad. She said he would not allow her to discipline them. If she did so when he was not at home, the children would report her to him when she came back home and chaos would ensue. She had tried to talk to him about the negative effect of his actions to no avail. So, to the children, dad is the greatest while mum is seen as strict.
There is a need to redefine the word ‘good’ if we are to be effective fathers. The word ‘good’ isn’t synonymous with letting your children have their way. It’s not when your children call you good that you are one, but when deep in your heart, you know that you have raised them to be better individuals for their own sake and to live a purposeful life. Being a good father is not about what you do but who you are. So, if we fathers learn to work on ourselves, we can effectively reach our children even though at present, they may not appreciate some of the instructions and reprimands we give them (just as in the days of our parents when we felt they were too strict on us).
