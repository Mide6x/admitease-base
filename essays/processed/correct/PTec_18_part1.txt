How to Get Your Own Website (5)
Creating a website has become much easier nowadays compared to the past. In general, website creation programs are simpler to use, and you also have the option of signing up with an online web host that provides easy-to-use page creation tools.
The most significant change has been the introduction of blogs. "Blog" is short for "web log." Initially, blogs served as online diaries where bloggers would log in, write a paragraph or two sharing their thoughts on various topics, and publish it, making their words accessible to anyone on the Internet. The appeal of blogs lies in their interactivity, allowing readers to comment on posts and link back to their own blogs or websites.
Over time, bloggers desired more features, such as easy photo uploads, additional site pages, and a variety of themes to better reflect their personality or business. Programmers, notably with WordPress, an established open-source platform, responded to these demands. Now, creating a website or blog involves the following steps:
- Register with a web host offering CPanel for a nominal monthly fee
- Install WordPress easily using Fantastico on your website's CPanel
- Choose a theme from pre-installed options or explore various themes on WordPress and other sites to find one that suits your needs
- Upload your chosen theme to the wp_content folder using a simple FTP program like WS_FTP or Cute FTP
- Start publishing your articles or comments
- Add extra pages to your site if desired
With the ability to add separate pages to blogs similar to standard websites, many individuals are opting for blogs as their preferred method of website creation. Through various plugins, you can customize your blog extensively.
