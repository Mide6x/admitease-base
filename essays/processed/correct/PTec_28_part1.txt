It has become evident to keen observers navigating the bustling streets of Lagos that Kia Motors has made a significant impact on the Nigerian and West African automotive industry. The introduction of the improved Cerato has set a new standard in the market.
Marketed with the slogan 'Unbeatable Value for Money,' the new Cerato delivers on its promise. From its spacious cabin and sleek design to its attractive exterior, every detail of the car reflects a vehicle designed with the driver in mind.
The new Cerato represents a complete rejuvenation in terms of design. Notably, the detailed yet cohesive front and rear headlamps and the enhanced shoulder lines contribute to the overall appeal of the car.
The new Cerato is a 4-door sedan available with a 1.6-liter engine and options for manual or automatic transmissions. With a wheelbase of 2650mm, the Cerato offers a spacious interior surpassing its pricier competitors. Rear passengers enjoy ample legroom and headspace, with the flat floor design enhancing comfort for those seated in the center.
Inside, the modern dashboard design complements the stylish exterior, creating a sophisticated ambiance. The interior, though not of the highest quality materials, exudes classiness through red illumination and well-designed switchgear.
The driving position is highly adjustable, with height adjustment for the seat and a tilt and telescopic steering column, a rare feature in its price range.
Powering the Cerato is a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing a robust 124bhp, making it one of the most powerful in its class. While performance is adequate, the engine provides a smooth power delivery across different speeds, although refinement could be improved, especially under heavy acceleration.
