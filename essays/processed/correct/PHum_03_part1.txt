The Unexplored Culture of Dance
Various types of music in Nigeria have been influenced by Western culture. Dr. Rasaki Ojo-Bakare, a theater director and choreographer at the University of Abuja, is encouraging Nigerians to take pride in their cultural heritage. Chinyere Okoye writes:
Dance and music are perhaps the two most vibrant forms of Nigerian art. They encompass various folk and popular music genres that rely heavily on strong rhythms provided by numerous drums and percussion instruments. Nigeria boasts a rich cultural heritage derived from the fusion of its diverse ethnic groups with Arabic and Western influences. Music and dance are essential components of Nigerian culture, with each ethnic group having its own unique specialties. Traditional instruments include various types of flutes, trumpets, musical bows, xylophones, wooden clappers, and a wide array of drums.
Dance in Nigeria comes in many forms; Ubakala reflects their value system and aids in conflict resolution while also bringing about change. Ishan stilt dancers don colorful costumes and contort themselves in mid-air. In contrast, the Tiv dance called ajo involves male dancers working in pairs, and another dance features teams of women performing a dance known as icough, composing songs about current events.
Dancers from Ekiti and Yoruba wear head masks during processional dances. The Hausa, who do not view dancing as a craft, categorize their dances into social dancing and ceremonial bòorii dances.
Nigerian culture mirrors the country's multi-ethnic population. Nigerians continue to treasure their traditional languages, music, dance, and literature. Nigeria is home to three major ethnic groups — Yoruba, Hausa-Fulani, and Igbo — along with numerous other ethnic groups. Thus, Nigerian culture is inherently multi-ethnic, placing significant value on various art forms, including ivory carving, grass weaving, woodcarving, leatherwork, calabash art, pottery, painting, cloth weaving, and glass and metal works.
