"War Child: A Novel" by Bruce Cerew
Upon witnessing the explosion, its creators had mixed reactions. However, one thing was certain: they had ushered in a new dimension to war and the equilibrium in our existence. "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds," cried Robert Oppenheimer as he watched the mushroom cloud of radioactive vapor rise into the cloud, leaving only fragments of jade green radioactive glass in the soil and a horrendous weapon of war for mankind.
The history of mankind is a tale of endless episodes of violence, death, bloodshed, and misery, all in the name of war. In spite of these harsh realities, mankind continues to be plagued by this terror. Benjamin Franklin once said, "There never was a good war or a bad peace," yet sadly, we are forced to hear and see the frightening images of innocent men, women, and children who have been murdered, maimed, raped, tortured, and scarred by conflicts in their localities.
Driven by the will to survive, the victims are forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in the indignity of life as hopeless nomads and refugees. In the process, they attempt to cross paths strewn with perils, despair, and hopelessness; many perish, some fall prey to uncertainty, and many never have another shot at the better life they desperately seek. Yet the fortunate few that brave the hazardous circumstances end up in the chains of destitution, discrimination, and under the constant shadow of fears in cities of Western nations.
"War Child" by Bruce Cerew is a book that chronicles the tales of war as seen through the eyes of a boy, Ray, its protagonist and victim of the horrors of conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The book paints a true picture of the plight of refugees and the horrors they are so atrociously forced upon by lending credence to the voices of the maimed men, women, and children scarred and ravaged by war.
