In Nigeria, there are 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, divided into six geopolitical zones (Northeast, Northwest, Northcentral, Southeast, Southwest, and South South). Rivers and Bayelsa in the South South zone are two of the states in oil-producing areas of the Niger Delta, Nigeria, where staple foods such as yam, cassava, cocoyam, and maize are abundant, though the staples are seasonal. Oil-producing areas (Eleme, Ogoni, Okrika, and Nembe) are fraught with petroleum exploration and exploitation, leading to widespread pollution of farmlands (soils), rivers, and underground water with hydrocarbons and dispersant products. Crude oil spillages on soil and indiscriminate discharge of effluents on farmlands contaminate the soils and waterbed, making them polluted and unsuitable for agricultural purposes. Crude oil spillage exerts adverse effects on plants by making toxic minerals in the soil available to plants and by reducing the soil pH; when the soil pH drops below 4.50, the productivity of most crops is adversely affected. As the people of Rivers and Bayelsa States are predominantly subsistent farmers, the bulk of plant nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, ash, moisture, and fiber) in their diets are derived from the consumption of staple foods (starchy root tubers, cereals, and legumes).
