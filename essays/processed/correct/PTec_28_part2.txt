The Cerato's four-speed automatic transmission offers fast and efficient shifts but lacks additional ratios, impacting performance and fuel efficiency. However, it features a manual mode that appeals to enthusiastic drivers.
Despite its simple suspension setup, the Cerato delivers a comfortable and well-damped ride akin to larger models. The body control in corners is commendable, with electronic stability control as a standard feature.
One area of improvement for the Cerato is its steering, which lacks feedback and feels artificial, detracting from the overall driving experience. Despite this drawback, the Cerato offers sufficient performance and a refined ride, with minor issues like cabin materials being the only notable flaws.
