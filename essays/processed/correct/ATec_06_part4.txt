the tropical lognormal raindrop size distribution proposed by Ajayi and Olsen (1985) was assumed, and as the distribution corresponds well to
convective thunderstorm rain types, the Z-R relationship suggested by Ajayi and Owolabi (1987) for tropical thunderstorm rain in the study was
used with a = 461 and b = 1.31
respectively.
This study encompasses the frequency range of 4â€“35 GHz currently utilized by
most service providers for terrestrial and Earth-space
communications. The mean annual cumulative distribution of point
rain rate P(R) recorded at the three locations
is employed to predict interference levels, with probabilities of
occurrence ranging from 1-10-3%.
Signal attenuation due to rain was assessed using
the Power law relationship between attenuation and rain rate, while
attenuation due to atmospheric gases was computed following the ITU-R
Rec. 676-3 (1997). The parameters of the power law
relationship for attenuation by thunderstorm rain, applicable to
tropical locations and utilized in the study, are detailed in Table 1
for vertically polarized signals exclusively.
