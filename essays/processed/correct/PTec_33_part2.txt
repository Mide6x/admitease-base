Tirri mentioned that the phone comes with six pre-installed games and a durable casing to withstand adverse conditions. Ngozi Anene, Nokia's Executive Commercial Manager, cautioned buyers against purchasing from roadside sellers, emphasizing that only authorized dealers in major markets have access to the new phone. She urged buyers to verify the IMEI number before making a purchase to avoid counterfeit products.
"We are concerned that counterfeit products are already circulating in the market. To prevent falling victim to fake dealers, my advice to users is to avoid purchasing from roadside sellers and only buy from authorized dealers," Anene emphasized.
