A Transport Worker advised his peers to remain faithful to their partners and emphasized the importance of condom use if fidelity is a challenge. Another participant, Ms. Precious Ifeoma, expressed, "The program has enlightened me on how best to manage my money."
Even though the program concluded with a final open community meeting, as stated by the Executive Director of Administration/Finance, Mrs. Adeyeye, the project's impact will continue. She mentioned, "After we leave, they (the community) will continue with the program, and we will only come to mentor them and follow up. It is a behavioral change community project," she affirmed.
To ensure the sustainability of the project within the community, a Community-Based Organization comprising all the target groups was established during the event. Mrs. Adeyeye further added, "Any activity they carry out, theyâ€™ll inform us, and our sponsor will be informed accordingly."
The event also featured drama presentations on HIV and AIDS and the presentation of awards to prominent leaders in the community who contributed to the project's success. The project was sponsored by USAID, facilitated by the Society for Family Health (SFH) in Lagos State, and executed by the Humanity Foundation for Peace and Development.
