“If you do a check, most of the children who are drug addicts come from wealthy and middle-class families. They would not know about drugs if they did not have the money to purchase them, but the truth is that the parents have lost out on what it really means to be a parent. They are not there to play the role which God has given to them.
“So if you want to have your children turn out right, you have to invest in it by creating time for them and make your children know what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. You must also teach your children how to go through life with the right inculcation of virtues, which is what would make them turn out to be good children and good adults and in the long run, good citizens,” she noted.
Every discussant at the Abuja pre-World Families Congress held at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre with the theme, “Plan of Action on the Family in Africa – Update,” focused on how to get families right. It was obvious that everybody at the congress recognized the fact that the problem in the world today is that parents have stopped parenting.
Speaking further, Bazuaye said, “These days we are talking about rebranding Nigeria; the focus should be on the children and particularly the parents, getting them to know the importance of their God-given role as parents. Being parents is not just bearing a child; you have to give that child a good background so that the child would turn out right and make you proud.”
She said FACH was also encouraging the government to recognize the fact that good parenting is a panacea to the development of society. The foundation, she said, is also out to encourage the government to introduce laws that cut across various sectors to make it possible for people to know that whatever work they are doing, they have to create time for their families, particularly the upbringing of the children by spending quality time with the children.
