Firm launches anti-piracy discs

A new technology has been introduced to combat music and video piracy. It provides musicians and video producers the option to select custom-made, piracy-protected Compact Discs (CDs) or Digital Video Discs (DVDs) for their creations. These protected discs are embedded with a unique encryption code post-authoring, restricting digital file transfers.

The technology incorporates the International Recording Media Association's Anti-Piracy Compliance Programme for all replicated optical discs and digital content. During a presentation of sample protected discs in Lagos, Mr. Tolu Osaigbovo, the Manager of Operations and Technology at Yemiâ€™s Media Ltd, mentioned that artists and producers can also choose the color of CDs or DVDs to distinguish them. Additionally, the company, in collaboration with Sony, offers a Dual Disc comprising a CD on one side and a DVD on the other, catering to artists seeking a deluxe album edition.

This innovation facilitates the creation of audio, video, and computer content on a single two-sided disc. The company duplicates the master copy using the safeguarded CDs or DVDs. Osaigbovo highlighted that a new and unique code is assigned to each title and release, making it extremely challenging to crack.

He further explained that all protected DVD-Videos are compatible with any DVD-Video or DVD-ROM device, meeting Sony's stringent standards for quality and performance. The technology effectively addresses copying from DVD to DVD, DVD to hard drive, and distribution over the internet.

In addition to opening record stores for distribution, the company offers exclusive packaging options such as the Steelbook Case, featuring a metal exterior and a plastic inner core. Mr. Soji Oseni, the Brand and Marketing Manager, disclosed that a standard CD costs approximately N185, while the deluxe edition will be priced at around N300 per unit.

The company aims to collaborate with agencies and organizations engaged in the fight against piracy.
