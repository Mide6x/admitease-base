Qubestreet and Afrovision Deliver NaijaBorn

Qubestreet Media and the AfroVision Group have partnered to produce NaijaBorn.com, a platform that connects Nigerians and friends worldwide. The site is set to launch this month in its first beta phase. Through this platform, Nigerians can connect, interact, and share their experiences in Lagos, London, Lisbon, or anywhere they may find themselves.

With the vision of Qubestreet Media's Francis Oghuma (NaijaBorn.com CEO and President, product) and AfroVisioN's Mambe Nanje Churchill (NaijaBorn.com CTO and President of Technology), NaijaBorn.com features a custom-built social networking engine that will establish a searchable, detailed, user-generated database of the global Nigerian community.

During the beta phase, NaijaBorn.com will showcase profiles of active members, a publicly generated blog, status update features, and a platform for users to upload music, art, and other media from their experiences. Presently, thousands of members have joined the emerging site from locations including New Zealand, Japan, Poland, Oyo, Ore, Ogbomoso, Texas, and Lagos, Nigeria. Members encompass established and aspiring entrepreneurs, medical and pre-law students, software developers, and more.

This website will serve as a valuable networking tool for individuals aiming to engage with the diverse Nigerian audience. Additional resources and features are set to be added to the site in the near future. Don't miss the opportunity to connect! Sign up today at www.naijaborn.com.
