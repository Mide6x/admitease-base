Tackling Unemployment
Every year, young, energetic, and vibrant graduates are discharged from the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in two batches. Many of them travel around in search of better opportunities in various multinational companies, private firms, banks, etc., but only a few are fortunate after numerous attempts. I have often pondered how unemployment can be prevalent in a country like Nigeria where barriers to business have not been firmly established (politicians have not prioritized this). How long will people sit idly by, waiting for the government to provide jobs? Do we genuinely believe the government can create jobs for everyone? What will happen to those who are not lucky enough to secure employment? These thoughts weigh heavily on me, which led me to decide to write about youth empowerment, at least for a series of four, as I believe empowering the youth is crucial because they are the future of Nigeria, and if they falter, the nation will suffer. Each time I see the despair on the faces of highly qualified yet unemployed individuals on the streets, it deeply affects me.
