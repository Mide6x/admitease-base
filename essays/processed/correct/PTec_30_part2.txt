To enhance the performance of the buses, Mercedes-Benz/Weststar, in collaboration with their strategic partners, is providing professional training on various bus models like Marcopolo, Busscar, Caio, Neobus, and Mascarello to fleet owners and drivers. Technical training is also offered to ensure the buses are operated professionally at all times.
"Weststar is committed to supporting the government's transport initiatives by making these buses available in Nigeria," noted Miss Ogunnowo.
In recent years, these buses have proven to be highly successful in their category. They boast unique characteristics such as elegant bodywork, relatively low emissions, noticeable fuel efficiency, and ease of maintenance.
