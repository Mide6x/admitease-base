Maternal Death: Addressing the Crisis Facing Nigerian Women
It took the loss of soldiers in an encounter with Niger Delta militants to prompt military authorities to launch an all-out offensive to apprehend and punish the perpetrators. Why? Because a life dedicated to serving the nation is considered invaluable and worth protecting. However, every day, numerous Nigerian women face the daunting challenge of childbirth, with many not surviving to share their joyous experiences. Shockingly, statistics from reliable sources indicate that maternal mortality in Nigeria is not only alarmingly high but also ranks among the highest globally. What is even more distressing is that despite the government's efforts to address the issue, it has largely been confined to mere rhetoric. This report is compiled by Sola Ogundipe and Chioma Obinna.
A recurring sentiment in Nigeria today is that the easiest way for a woman to face death is through pregnancy. "Approximately every 10 minutes, a Nigerian woman loses her life due to pregnancy-related complications, and hundreds of thousands more suffer injuries from birth-related incidents every year." This grim reality was highlighted as the world observed Safe Motherhood Day on May 26, 2009. Undoubtedly, this paints a bleak picture of the state of affairs in Nigeria.
It is an undeniable fact that women in Nigeria are succumbing to pregnancy-related complications before, during, and after childbirth. The outcry over the avoidable loss of lives has become so commonplace that it echoes like a broken record. Whether it is the sorrow of a woman falling victim to pregnancy-related complications or the tale of another woman surviving but left with lifelong struggles, the underlying narrative remains the same - a nationwide lament over the tragic loss of lives due to maternal mortality.
