It is widely acknowledged that Nigeria possesses the knowledge and means to combat maternal mortality and morbidity through basic interventions like malaria prevention, adequate nutrition, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and access to emergency obstetrical care. Nigeria has the capacity to save the lives of women and their infants, yet it is disheartening to note that more needs to be done to stem the tide of maternal deaths and enhance the well-being of women. Amidst challenges in the healthcare system and service delivery at all levels of governance, there is much room for improvement. If only Nigerian women could stop perishing in the process of giving life.
Linking maternal health with other Millennium Development Goals
The Millennium Development Goal on Maternal Health aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters by 2015. In the developing world, the risk of maternal death due to pregnancy-related complications is significantly higher compared to industrialized nations. Most maternal deaths are preventable, with better healthcare during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period being key interventions.
Effective interventions to improve maternal health include antenatal care, provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care, postpartum care, and family planning in alignment with national policies. These interventions, when integrated across a continuum of care encompassing home, community, outreach, and facility-based services, yield multiple benefits for mothers, children, and communities.
Progress has been made in improving maternal health interventions globally. Antenatal care coverage has increased, with 75% of expectant mothers receiving some form of antenatal care. Many countries have also enhanced skilled delivery attendance. Ensuring the presence of skilled personnel at all deliveries and providing access to emergency care when needed is crucial in saving maternal lives.
However, the pace of progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal on maternal health has been sluggish across the developing world and must be accelerated to meet the 75% reduction in maternal mortality ratio set between 1990 and 2015. Addressing maternal health within a continuum of care that integrates essential maternal, newborn, and child health services is imperative.
