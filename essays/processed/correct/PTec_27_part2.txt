Convergence is now a reality. A notable expert opinion states: "ICT convergence is deeply ingrained in our daily lives, influencing every aspect, often unnoticed. It extends beyond VoIP, IPTV, and mobile content to encompass IP integration across all realms. Next-generation convergence involves ongoing technological, infrastructural, consumer behavior, and competitive dynamics shifts, fostering new companies, business models, and reshaping various industries like media, telecoms, and IT."
VoIP currently handles a significant portion of Nigeria's international voice traffic and is increasingly shaping consumer behavior. Consumers' preferences for voice services have changed, largely influenced by the growing popularity of Skype, Google, Yahoo voice services, among others. Many businesses are promoting the use of Skype and other Internet-based voice applications to reduce communication costs.
The traditional annual budget allocated for communication is rapidly decreasing. Forward-thinking organizations prefer consolidating their communication needs, including video conferencing, heavy document transfers, and voice communication, through a unified platform rather than paying for multiple services.
