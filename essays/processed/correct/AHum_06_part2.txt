Most simple verbs in Urhobo are either monosyllabic or disyllabic and typically start with a consonant segment. In the verb class, there are no minimal pairs where the only difference in meaning arises from tone patterns. While nouns can be classified based on their tone patterns, verbs cannot. In the citation form, all verbs and monosyllabic subject and object pronouns are realized with a low tone. Although various tonal variations exist in verbs, these are usually influenced by the grammatical contexts in which they are used. Consequently, verbs with similar syllable structures behave similarly within the same grammatical context. For instance, all monosyllabic verbs exhibit similar tonal behavior in a past tense construction, just as all disyllabic verbs do. Urhobo verbs, along with monosyllabic subject and object pronouns, are assumed to be inherently toneless and acquire tone based on their grammatical context. Therefore, tone carries significant syntactic weight, particularly in the verb phrase. To analyze tonal variations in the Urhobo verb phrase, it is essential to acknowledge the presence of tonal morphemes (tomorphs) or grammatical tones as integral components of the grammar. These tomorphs can be single-tone units or fixed tonal patterns that hold grammatical significance independently of segmental strings. They are distinct from lexical tones and are segmented in specific positions within the grammatical structure, often leading to the dissociation or gliding of lexical tones.
In this section, we will explore grammatical constructions in the three fundamental tenses: present, past, and future.
