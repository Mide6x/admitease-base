Worldwide, cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in women. It continues to be the second most common female cancer worldwide after breast carcinoma. The prevalence of genital HPV infection in the world is around 440 million. It is estimated that there were almost 260,000 deaths from cervical cancer in 2005, and 2.7 million years of life lost. About 500,000 cases of cervical cancer are estimated to occur each year, and over 80% of which occur in developing countries where neither population-based routine screening nor optimal treatment is available. The highest estimated incidence rates of cervical cancer occur in Africa, Central and South America, and Asia. In Nigeria, very few women are screened for cervical cancer; in fact, it is estimated that only 10% of female physicians in Nigeria have ever had a Pap smear themselves. In another study conducted in a tertiary institution in Nigeria, seventy-one percent were aware of cervical cancer, while only 33 percent were aware of Papanicolaou's smear. It is estimated that without a significant improvement in prevention, there will be a million new cases of HPV by the year 2049.
Predisposing factors to HPV infection include sexual activity, prior Sexually Transmitted Infections, early sexual debut, prolonged use of birth control pills, women who smoke, and having same-sex or multiple sexual partners. Genital HPV infection is extremely common and most often causes no symptoms. HPV is transmitted through sexual intercourse; however, transmission can occur without penetrative sex, as HPV is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact in the genital area. Therefore, every sexually active woman is at risk. 50-80% of women will acquire an HPV infection in their lifetime, and up to 50% of those infections will be oncogenic HPV types. Progressions from HPV infection to Cervical Cancer are slow and usually take years. Hence, the infection is usually more prevalent among women aged 35-50.
