signal is interfered by a signal from a terrestrial microwave
network operating at the same frequency as the satellite system.
In such cases, there is typically a decline in the
signal-to-noise ratio at the satellite terminal due to energy being
redirected forward into its receiving
antenna system.
Assessing the received interference power is crucial
for designing microwave communication systems. Past efforts
have been made to quantify interference levels either
through direct measurement or simulation. Some of these efforts
include Crane (1974), Awaka (1989), Olsen et al. (1993), Holt et al. (1993),
and Capsoni and Dâ€™Amico (1997). While these endeavors have yielded
favorable results in temperate regions, minimal
attention has been given to addressing this issue in tropical
regions. Ajewole et al. (1999a) and Ajewole (2003) studied the
problem using radio-climatological data from Nigeria to predict
interference levels on propagation paths in Nigeria.
Despite the extensive research conducted in temperate regions, the
findings from such studies are often insufficient for tropical paths.
This is because the nature and characteristics of tropical rainfall
differ at times from those of temperate regions. Tropical
rainfall is frequently convective, characterized by large
raindrop sizes, high intensity, and often accompanied by
severe lightning and thunderstorms. If a convective rain cell traverses
the common volume formed by the intersecting beams of a
satellite downlink antenna and a terrestrial microwave relay
system, interference will occur in the satellite system as
long as the frequencies match. Furthermore, the satellite signal
experiences additional rain attenuation (Figure 1) along its path,
thus, relying solely on transmission loss statistics will not be
sufficient to predict the interference received by the desired
satellite channel. This additional attenuation has the potential
to further diminish the signal-to-noise ratio at the satellite terminal.
Hence, the evaluation of this additional attenuation is crucial
in determining the effective transmission loss on the path, and
if it exceeds the link margin, it could lead to a complete
outage of the satellite channel regardless of the interference levels
from the terrestrial system. Therefore, it is imperative to account
for this extra attenuation of the desired signal in analyzing
