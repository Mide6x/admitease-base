The 318-page "War Child" is written as a narrative and employs a simple diction to tell its story. It is a tale of humor and tragedy, courage and fear, hopelessness and anticipation, love and betrayal, hope, and triumph. "War Child" is set in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Netherlands.
The book begins with Ray’s struggles in life beginning from an early age in Eastern Nigeria. The young Ray was constantly abused by his father (a compulsive gambler and an alcoholic) who could not come to terms with the boy’s inadequacies. Ray was thus sent away to the village of Amata to live with his grandmother. There, Ray finds love, fear, and a mysterious character in whom he suddenly finds a friend and comforter.
Now grown, the boy Ray puts aside childhood traumas and insecurities, returning to the city in search of a livelihood. But his hallucinations reappeared, handing him the feeling of emptiness and his fears and delusions.
In search of greener pastures away from the hassles of life in Nigeria, Ray emigrates to Monrovia. But before he could settle in, the country was thrown into conflict. The war ushered in a time of bloodshed, death, sorrow, and anguish. Ray was forced to flee to Freetown, Sierra Leone, in the hope for a life away from the misery of carnage in Liberia. But yet again, the gates of Hell were cast open.
The second part of "War Child" begins Ray’s eventual flight to the Netherlands, where Ray meets Jamo and Bar. The plot in the tale of their freedom from war, poverty, and uncertainty in Africa climaxes with the rejection, misgivings, and hardships of life in the observation camp. Living with other refugees, the trio are challenged by myriad elements and the harsh realities of life in the West.
