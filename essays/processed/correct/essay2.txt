I have faced numerous challenges in my life. One traumatic incident occurred when armed robbers invaded our home at night. I was pursued relentlessly, an experience that revealed the severity of security issues in Nigeria. This event left me with lingering anxiety, particularly when hearing unexpected noises at night. While my mother advises persistent prayer, I firmly believe systemic governmental reforms are crucial.
