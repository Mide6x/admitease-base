The high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in Nigeria have persisted, drawing concern and raising alarms. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, a Nigerian woman faces a 1-in-18 risk of maternal death or pregnancy-related causes during her lifetime, surpassing the 1-in-22 risk for women across sub-Saharan Africa. The risk is even higher for women in northern Nigeria, rural areas, and those with limited education and financial resources. This crisis of maternal mortality persists across the country, from Lagos to Maiduguri, Calabar to Sokoto, with no signs of abating.
The statistics are indeed staggering, with a significant number of deaths that are profoundly unsettling. It is estimated that approximately 59,000 Nigerian women lose their lives annually due to pregnancy-related complications, second only to India in global maternal mortality rankings. Nigeria is undeniably grappling with a maternal mortality epidemic, contributing about 10% of the world's total maternal deaths.
This harrowing reality stems from findings indicating that Nigeria has one of the highest maternal mortality rates globally, accounting for roughly 10% of all maternal deaths worldwide. For every woman who perishes, 15 to 20 others endure short or long-term disabilities, such as obstetric fistulae, uterine ruptures, paralysis, and complications like Vesico Vaginal Fistulae (VVF).
Maternal death, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to the "death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination, due to causes related to or aggravated by pregnancy but not incidental or accidental causes." Pregnancy-related death, on the other hand, encompasses the death of a woman during pregnancy or within 42 days of pregnancy termination, regardless of the cause of death.
