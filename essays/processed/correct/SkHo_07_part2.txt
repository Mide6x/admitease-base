Within the family, starting from husband and wife, romance disappears, fun diminishes, and tempers set in when partners cannot enjoy each other’s company and closeness. The family’s physical and mental health can be affected by the lack of care in controlling odors. We need to take care of our bodies as well as our environments. In Nigeria, the lack of water and electricity can compound our efforts.
The body areas of concern are the scalp (for black women), the mouth, the armpits, the genital areas, and the feet. These areas typically harbor moisture from sweat and microbes that thrive in such conditions. The microbes include bacteria and fungi, and we need to learn how to prevent their growth. Personal habits, cleanliness of our environment including the air, and using medical remedies are all important for controlling body odor.
Habits include regular grooming practices such as manicures, pedicures, teeth flossing, and daily grooming. Generally, prevention is better than cure. Dirt should be removed, not covered up. Spraying perfume to mask smells is not hygienic. The effort should be to keep bacterial and fungal growth under control. Washing oneself well and then enhancing freshness with perfume makes us pleasant. Using too much perfume can be distracting or disturbing to others. In the tropics, bathing twice daily is a common habit. Changing clothes, especially undergarments, after each use instead of reusing them before washing is essential.
Black women with permed hair sometimes insist on keeping a style until it wears out. This may be too many days during which sweat and microbial activity can accumulate odors. Women, therefore, need to have alternative ways of presenting their hair: styling, washing, and packing, as well as effectively using head-ties, attachments, and wigs alternately with hair styling. Thus, they can maintain beauty without compromising hygiene.
