The commitment of the Federal Ministry of Health signals a potential shift in the narrative. Maternal survival took center stage during Nigeria's participation in the 62nd World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, in May 2009. The country engaged in discussions with leading experts in women's healthcare to address the pressing issue. Health Minister Prof. Babatunde Osotimehin outlined various initiatives aimed at improving maternal health, including midwifery schemes, anti-shock garments with blood transfusion services, and enhancing primary healthcare centers with additional resources and improved accessibility.
Furthermore, underscoring the pivotal role of healthcare professionals in ensuring safe motherhood, Osotimehin has advocated for increased skilled birth attendance at delivery points. He emphasizes the need for skilled attendants equipped with necessary skills, supported by conducive healthcare environments at various levels, inclusive of supportive policies, adequate supplies, equipment, infrastructure, efficient communication systems, and referral mechanisms.
While attributing factors such as limited coverage of essential services like efficient family planning, postnatal care, and addressing health challenges such as hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, infections, unsafe abortions, malaria, and anemia, the Minister emphasizes that the high maternal, newborn, and child health indices in the country are unacceptable. He points to the Federal government's implementation of the Integrated Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (IMNCH) Strategy across states as part of ongoing efforts to address these challenges.
According to Dr. Suomi Sakai, UNICEF Representative in Nigeria, "We know how to reduce maternal mortality and illness; it can be done." Basic interventions such as preventing and treating malaria, providing adequate nutrition and antenatal care, training birth attendants, and ensuring healthcare facilities offer emergency obstetrical care are crucial in saving women's lives and safeguarding their children.
With the theme "Skilled Birth Delivery, A Must for Every Mother," there is a rallying call for collective action from all stakeholders to implement a strategic plan aimed at significantly reducing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. While commendable efforts have been made by the government to address maternal mortality, which remains one of the highest globally, the battle is far from over. The narrative surrounding maternal mortality in Nigeria remains contradictory.
