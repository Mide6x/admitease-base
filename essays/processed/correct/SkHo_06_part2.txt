The reality is that the average young Nigerian's mindset is to attend school, excel academically, and then seek a well-paying job. There is a lack of focus on creating job opportunities, which perpetuates the cycle of job scarcity for job seekers. It is baffling to witness families where every member is unemployed, not due to a lack of qualified individuals but because they struggle to find employment. I believe there are numerous opportunities in this country once individuals shift away from the mindset of merely seeking jobs or opening a conventional shop. People need to foster innovation; indeed, our country exhibits a significant entrepreneurial spirit, surpassing that of any other sub-Saharan African nation. Let me share some insight - in the absence of jobs, there lies an opportunity to generate income. Establishing a vocational school where individuals can learn technical skills could be a viable option. By securing a venue, possibly a school for evening classes, and recruiting skilled instructors in their respective fields, this endeavor could be successful. Funding can be sourced from local government authorities, politicians, or companies. You never know what you can accomplish until you start thinking and taking action.
As a recent graduate, engaging in temporary jobs to earn some income before your NYSC program and initiating a venture could be beneficial. Making sacrifices during your service year to save money and preparing to start a small business post-service, based on your expertise, can lead to success if you remain focused. For young entrepreneurs, this could be an opportunity for growth. The packaging industry in Nigeria remains largely untapped. Simple products like garri, palm oil, or plantain chips could be reimagined in innovative packaging to attract consumers willing to pay a premium for quality. With a population exceeding 150 million, satisfying just 1% of this populace and making a small profit per customer could result in significant earnings. Thorough market research and identifying the needs of your target market are essential for success.
