To investigate the factors influencing air-lift pump performance, experiments were conducted using a model rig as depicted in Figure 1. The rig comprises a transparent plastic reservoir tank with a riser pipe (10mm – 25mm) and an air line connected to an air compressor. The lift refers to the liquid height above the static level, while submergence is the length of air pipe submerged beneath the static level.
Description of the Experiment
The reservoir tank was filled with water, and a riser pipe of varying uniform diameters (10mm – 25mm) was placed in the tank with the air line attached. The pipe submergence was measured, and air was then pumped into the riser pipe's injection point. The pump lift (liquid height above static level) was measured, and the experiment was repeated five times. Subsequently, a riser pipe of different diameter was used, and the experiment was repeated. This process was repeated with kerosene, gasoline, and liquid water-solid mixtures, and the experimental runs were repeated for each case.
Results and Discussion
Tables 1 (a-c) present the results obtained with kerosene. The air pressure ranged from 13.8 kN/m2 to 172.4 kN/m2, with submergence varying from 30cm to 25cm. Figure 2 illustrates a graphical plot of lift against submergence ratio for different fluids, showing that pump lift increases with higher pipe submergence ratios. Figure 3 depicts a plot of pump lift against pressure for various liquids, indicating that smaller riser pipes yielded higher lift compared to larger diameter pipes where slippage was more pronounced.
Table 2 shows the results from experiments with a sand and water mixture, with Figure 4 providing a graphical representation. It was observed that the lift for the mixture was lower compared to pure liquids across different air pressures and submergences, likely due to the mixture's higher density and lower cohesive properties.
