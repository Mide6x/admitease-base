HTC Magic, iPhone Killer? Not Yet
Since Apple Inc. revolutionized the smartphone industry with the release of the iPhone, various phone manufacturers have made efforts to match its functionality and hype. Samsung introduced the Omnia, LG the Prada, and even RIM with the Blackberry Storm. Now, HTC, the manufacturer of the “HTC Touch HD Pro” smartphone, presents the HTC Magic in white.
The introduction of the HTC Magic is the result of a successful collaboration between Vodafone and HTC, with Vodafone joining the Open Handset Alliance late last year.
The HTC Magic weighs a reasonable 118g compared to the iPhone's 133g. The 3.2-inch capacitive touch screen with 16 million colors and 320x480 pixels display puts it slightly behind the iPhone.
In terms of memory, the HTC Magic offers unlimited entries in the phone book, a micro SD card slot (which is unexpected for a phone of this caliber), 192 MB RAM, 512MB ROM, and a Qualcomm MSM 7201A 528 MHz processor.
Connectivity features include GSM 850/900/1800/1900 on a 2G network, HSDPA 900/2100 on a 3G network, WiFi (802.11b/g), and Bluetooth primarily for headset support. GPS is included, which should be a standard feature by now.
The operating system, Android, compensates for any shortcomings the HTC Magic may have, providing strong competition to other mobile operating systems like Symbian and Mac OSX on the iPhone.
The HTC Magic boasts a 3.2-megapixel camera with autofocus, video recording capabilities, and a secondary camera, surpassing the iPhone's 2.0-megapixel camera without video or secondary camera features. The Magic's battery offers 7 hours and 30 minutes of talk time, falling short of the iPhone's 10-hour capacity.
While the iPhone may not be superior to the HTC Magic, each has its strengths. To outperform the iPhone, the HTC Magic would benefit from more internal memory, at least 8GB, a 3.5mm headset jack, video player, TV-out, improved battery life, increased hype, and more.
