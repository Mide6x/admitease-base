If we want to be good fathers, we must learn to communicate with our children not only through actions but also through positive words. Many fathers are old-school. Many dads never say to their children, "I am proud of you" or "I love you" or "I'm sorry," etc. I agree with what Gerald Anthony wrote on the topic, ‘How to be a good father,’ when he said: "It’s a sort of a cliché that fathers are proud of their children... but many fathers don’t realize how important it is to actually tell their kids, not just their friends and co-workers! Your kids need to know that you’re proud of them for ... and the things that they do that you show them you’re proud of are the things they will try to do again. If you show them that you are proud of their good grades, they will strive for good grades ... if you show them that you are proud of them being a good person, or good with their siblings, or something else, they will do whatever it is that made you proud again (or at least try)."
To be a good father, we must prioritize self-improvement. When I speak at relationship meetings, I often mention that very few men read books on relationships. When you see men with books, over 80 percent of the time, it’s a book on finance - how to make more money. I believe that the worst way to learn something is through experience. Truly, we don’t know things by default; we are meant to learn. Every father should pick up a book on how to properly raise their children, read it, and act on the advice given.
