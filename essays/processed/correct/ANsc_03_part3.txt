Foods are necessary for humans for growth, development, reproduction, and energy. The poor nutritional status of Nigerians and malnutritional disorders are due to complex factors such as pollution, low productivity and quality, and the presence of toxicants in foods that need to be destroyed by heat treatment. For instance, heat treatment has been shown to inactivate trypsin inhibitors from the African yam bean. Yams are species of Dioscorea and belong to the Dioscoreaceae family propagated from tubers and grow best in deep, well-drained soils. They are peeled, boiled, and pounded to produce a gelatinous dough called pounded yam, which is consumed with soup. Yam flour, as a local soup thickener, is used to prepare afiaefere or white soup and is a good source of starch. Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a root crop that belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is propagated from stem cuttings. The root is a cheap source of carbohydrates for humans and livestock. Fermented cassava roots are boiled and pounded into a thick paste called fufu, which is consumed with soup. The root can be cooked and eaten with red palm oil and sauces. The roots may be peeled, grated, fermented, and fried with or without red palm oil into garri flour, in which form it is mainly consumed in Nigeria. Taro cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta) and tannia species (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) are mostly available and consumed members of the Araceae family. Young leaves of taro cocoyam are eaten in Nigeria and other West African countries as vegetable food for ruminants, particularly sheep and goats. Cocoyam is a good source of carbohydrates and energy and is usually eaten boiled or roasted.
