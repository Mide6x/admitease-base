Now that you know where you are (your financial situation) and are ready to move forward, it is important that you also understand who you are. By this, I mean your inner self. What is your passion? Follow your passion and start to determine in which direction your energies can be better utilized for effective results. There are generally four categories of people. The category you fall into is usually determined by who you are inside, your strengths, your fears, your likes, and dislikes. This explains why one man's meat is another man's poison.
For example, are you an employee? This category of people prefers a good steady job where the salaries are guaranteed every month with good benefits to back it up. They are mainly individuals who are security-oriented, and they are happy in employment once there exists binding agreements with their employers. They could be CEOs, Secretaries, or even Security personnel in any organization, but insecurity and uncertainty are their worst enemies. So, if you are one of those who hate the feeling of fear that comes with economic uncertainty and you are unwilling to take the risk of self-employment, then employment with a secure organization with good benefits will be the best for you.
Others prefer to be self-employed. These are usually professionals who desire nothing other than to be their own boss. They hate having their income being dictated by others. If they work hard, they expect to be paid well for it, and they are not in any way disturbed if they receive nothing for work left undone. The self-employed type expects their pay to be commensurate with the quality of their work. They are true artists with their own style of doing things and usually believe that no one can do a better job.
