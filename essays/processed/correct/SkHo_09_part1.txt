Treadmill vs. Outdoor Walking
When comparing the benefits of using a motorized treadmill at home versus walking outdoors, the debate arises on which is more advantageous for exercise. Below are some of the advantages and disadvantages of each.
Outdoor Walking
One significant advantage of walking outdoors is the opportunity to challenge your balance and stability by navigating small obstacles, dodging obstacles, starting and stopping. This not only enhances distance walking but also contributes to overall health, particularly as we age, by maintaining stabilizing muscles. Here are some aspects to consider when walking outside versus on a treadmill:
- Negotiating up and down curbs, steps, short stairways, and stepping over small obstacles, which engages climbing muscles.
- Walking on sloped sidewalks and road sides which poses a challenge to your balance.
- Maneuvering through crowds, puddles, and pets, which requires lateral as well as forward movement.
- Halting and starting at street crossings, which challenges the muscles to pause and restart.
- Unlike treadmills that primarily offer uphill or level surfaces, outside terrain provides the added challenge of walking downhill, engaging muscles differently.
- On a treadmill, the belt moves, potentially hindering a proper push-off from your back foot. It is essential to focus on executing this movement correctly.
Outdoor Distance Training vs. Treadmill
For training purposes such as preparing for a 10K, half marathon, or marathon, it is advisable to incorporate outdoor long-distance walks rather than solely relying on treadmill workouts. While treadmills are suitable for shorter sessions lasting 30-60 minutes and for refining walking posture and technique, long, slow distance training should be conducted outdoors.
During extended events, as muscles fatigue, maintaining proper walking form becomes crucial. Utilizing different muscle groups due to fatigue can lead to discomfort in unfamiliar areas. Outdoor training emphasizes balance, stability, and varied terrains, unlike the consistent surface of a treadmill, which can result in fewer post-event aches when training outdoors.
