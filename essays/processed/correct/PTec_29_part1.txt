Toyota Camry Redesigned for 2010
The award-winning Toyota Camry, a mid-size four-door sedan available in four trim levels, has undergone several updates to establish itself as a formidable contender in 2010. One of the key improvements is the introduction of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine, replacing the previous 2.4-liter unit and offering two variations, as reported by TAJUDEEN ADEBANJO.
The 2010 Toyota Camry embodies the qualities of a dependable vehicle on the road. It boasts a spacious cabin, an exceptionally refined and fuel-efficient V6 engine, a smooth and quiet ride, and outstanding crash test ratings, among other features.
Notable changes include a redesigned grille and taillights, an optional new audio system with satellite radio and Bluetooth for base and LE models, and auto up/down windows on all four doors. Additionally, stability control now comes standard across all model variants.
The 2010 Toyota Camry is a midsize sedan available in four trim levels: base, LE, SE, and XLE. The base model comes equipped with a four-cylinder engine, while the other trims offer a choice between the four-cylinder and a V6 engine.
The base Camry includes features like 16-inch steel wheels, air conditioning, auto up/down windows for all doors, a six-speaker CD audio system with an auxiliary input jack, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, full power accessories, and a 60/40 split-folding rear seat. The LE trim adds keyless entry and an eight-way power driver's seat.
The SE model features a sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, and unique interior and exterior styling elements. On the other hand, the luxurious XLE model reverts to the softer suspension settings of the LE, with 16-inch wheels, and offers an upgraded JBL-branded sound system with an in-dash CD changer, satellite radio, Bluetooth connectivity for phone and music, automatic dual-zone climate control, a power passenger seat, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, reclining rear seats, a moonroof, wood-tone accents, and leather seating for the V6 model.
