For this group of people, their independence, freedom, and the desire to gain respect as experts in their field are much more important to them. They find it difficult to employ people like themselves because they have the notion that no one can be as good as them. And this means that they have to work much harder because most things are done by them. This group responds to their fears not by seeking security but by taking control of their destiny.
Or are you a business owner? These are risk-takers, individuals with good leadership qualities and great drive with the ability to set up a good system that works. They may be but not necessarily professionals or graduates but they surround themselves with competent people. The business owner's skills are not usually taught in schools, and that is why some of the wealthiest people on earth have quit school to become very successful businessmen. They love to delegate duties and are willing to pay for services rendered. The personnel they hire could come from any or all the categories. They are not afraid to bear the risk of investing in their own business.
Then there are the investors: This is the rich man's playground where money works to make money. They are not the typical 9-5 workers or the very 'hard-working' type. They are already done with that. What distinguishes them from the others is their readiness to take investment risks that some others would never contemplate. If you hope to be rich one day, no matter which of the above categories you make your money from, you will ultimately need to get here. This is the place of extreme financial freedom. The place I would love to be!
