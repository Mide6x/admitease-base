throwing a feat or a punch at our children won’t help them grow up
as emotionally stable individuals. Screaming at them isn’t an
effective medium of communication either. Have you observed that
when you tell your children to do things out of anger, they often
turn up not doing it well. Their minds seem to shut down when they
are screamed at. The old time religion of being smacked for every
wrong done is also not too effective when it’s done out of anger
instead of love. One other emotion that must be put in check is
love that doesn’t give room for correction. You should never love
your children to the point they would become no good; you should
give room for them to be corrected.
To be a good dad, we must let their mum have her way. In the
days of our fathers, it was common to find daddies reprimanding
mummies in the presence of the children. Sometimes, it’s because
mummy ‘over-reacted’ in the way she
acted to them when they did wrong. In such a family where this is
common, you will always find the pampered children eventually
becoming a nuisance to the parents (both daddy and mummy).
I am of the opinion that when it comes to raising our children,
we must learn to respect their mothers’ opinions. I heard my wife
say to my son once, ‘don’t touch that juice yet, it’s too early to
put it in your belly’. A few minutes later, he walked to the bed
with his lovely eyes begging for daddy to over turn mummy’s word. I
was tempted, but I said NO. If you feel that their mum is too hard
on them, then call her later when the children are not there to
express your feeling.
If we will be good fathers, we must learn to express ourselves
to our children not just by actions but by affirmative words. Many
of our fathers are old skool.
Many daddies would never say to their children I am proud of you or
