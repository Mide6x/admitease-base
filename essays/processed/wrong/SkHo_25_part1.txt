Your path to success and wealth
By now, I am sure that we are all conscious of our financial
health and no longer wrongfully assume that the future will take
care of itself (faith without works???)
In the last edition, we focused on two major points:
(a) The need to identify your heartâ€˜s desire, that is knowing
exactly what you really want, and;
(b) The need to personalize that desire to suit your
circumstance.
Having settled that, the next step will be to determine exactly
where you are-Your true financial
situation, not what you think you have or what you hope to have.
So, I suggest you start by asking yourself the following
questions:
-What are your income, lifestyle and equity goals?
-Is there any way you can streamline your spending to fit into
your budget?
-Where did your money go, and how can you increase your
wealth?
-Are there strategies for generating new sources of wealth?
-How do you quit your unnecessary spending habits that
inevitably run you into debts?
-How do you develop the habit of saving in order to achieve
financial freedom?
TIME TO TAKE STOCK
Now, write down the following: your present earning, how much
money you have in the bank (if any), your debt profile, your net
worth and more particularly, your expenses on daily, weekly or
monthly basis. If you are not happy with the result of this
stock-taking, then, it is time to seriously consider how best to
move from your financial struggle to financial freedom.
SO, WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM?
I told you in the previous edition that there are a lot of ways
to get rich, which include: chance, speculation, inheritance,
theft, extortion, contract scams, counterfeiting, 419, kidnapping,
etc.But I also said that
MoneySense is only
interested in ONE WAY:
The Legitimate Way
Now that you know where you are (your financial situation) and
are ready to move forward, it is important that you also understand
who you are. By this, I mean your inner self. What is your passion?
