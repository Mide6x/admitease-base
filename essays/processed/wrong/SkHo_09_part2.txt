have been doing your long slow distance training outdoors.
Incline on the treadmill — all uphill, no
downhill
Treadmills can be useful for adding incline if you are in an
area without hills, but I’ll bet you can work some stairs into your
workout if you look for them to help build the uphill and downhill
muscles. This is the big problem with treadmills — there is no
downhill! You use different muscles to go downhill, and I never see
a loop walking course where you only go uphill. You need to train
those downhill muscles as well.
Advantages of Treadmill vs. Outside Walking
Using a treadmill for your regular workouts is a great way to
burn calories and give basic training to your walking muscles and
practice your walking form.
· Workout Programs: You may enjoy the pre-programmed workouts
the treadmill offers to give you a controlled workout challenge.
The treadmill may also have readouts for heart rate, calories
burned, etc. which give you data feedback.
· More Speed = More Calories Burned: Most people set their
treadmill workout for time rather than for distance, and can often
go faster on a treadmill due to lack of obstacles.
