can’t, please use condom," he warned. For another participant,
the programme is an eye opener "because I now know how best to
manage my money," said Ms Precious Ifeoma.
Although the programme according to the Executive Director
Admin/Finance, Mrs Adeyeye, is a final open Community meeting but
it does not end there.
"After we leave, they (community) will continue with the
programme, we’ll only come to mentor them and follow them up.
"It is a behavioural change Community project," said
Adeyeye.
To ensure community of the project, a Community Based
Organisation comprising all the target groups was inaugurated at
the event. "Any activity they carry out, they’ll inform us and
our sponsor will get to know about it," she said.
Other highlights of the event was drama presentations on HIV and
AIDs as well as presentation of
award to notable leaders in the community who have contributed to
the success of the project. The project was sponsored by USAID,
anchored by Society for Family Health (SFH) in Lagos State and
implemented by Humanity Foundation for Peace and Development.
