UNIFIED SMART HOME :
ITUapproves G.hn as standard for wired home
networking
IT seems as if the International Telecommunications Union, ITU,
is bench marking the growth of world technological improvements
with activities in the Nigeria ICT sector. This is as the world
telecom body, at the weekend, approved new standard tagged G.hn, for wiring new digital offerings like High Definition TV
(HDTV) and digital Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) in homes.
The cutting-edge technical standard, according to ITU, would
usher in new era in smart home networking systems and applications.
The standard, is expected to enable service providers to deploy
High Definition TV (HDTV) and digital Internet Protocol TV (IPTV)
among others at more cost effective platforms.
It will also allow consumer electronics manufacturers to
seamlessly network all types of home entertainment, home automation
and home security products, and greatly simplify consumersâ€™
purchasing and installation processes.
G.hn-compliant devices will be capable of handling
high-bandwidth rich multimedia content at speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s
over household wiring options, including coaxial cable and standard
phone and power lines.
This development reinforces the statement made by the ITU
secretary General, Dr Hamadoun Toure, recently in Abuja Nigeria,
that in the next five to seven years, all homes in Africa may have
been connected with cheap broadband and internet access as well as
other new offering like HDTV and IPTV.
It also reinforces the business foresight of notable Nigerian
business men and women like, Chief Raymond Dokpesi who flagged off
his PayTV system, DAARSAT, on the platform of High definition TV
when existing operators were yet to migrate to the platform,
Chairman of Globacom, Otunba Mike Adenuga jr, and CEO of MainOne,
Mrs Funke Opeke, who respectively, invested heavily in multimillion
dollar submarine fibre cable systems, knowing that it is where the
future of world broadband connections is heading to.
Both landed their projects in Lagos Nigeria recently from UK and
Portugal respectively, signalling the take of cheap connection of
new offerings and services to homes in Nigeria, West Africa and
indeed the entire African continent.
