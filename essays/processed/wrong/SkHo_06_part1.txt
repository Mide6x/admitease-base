Tackling Unemployment
Every year, young, energetic, and vibrant graduates are being
pumped out of NYSC in two batches. Many of them travel here and
there in search of greener pasture in several multinational
companies, private companies, banks etc. but only a few
remain lucky after several attempt. Seriously I have always
wondered how unemployment can be high in a country like Nigeria
where barriers to business have not yet been set up (the
politicians haven't had time). But how long will people fold
their arms and remain hungry waiting for government to give them
jobs? Do we really think government can provide jobs for all? What
then will happen to the unlucky ones that will never get a job?
That’s what pumps into my mind, so I made up my mind to write on
youth empowerment, atleast for

hopelessness on the faces of highly qualified but jobless people
eats at my soul.
The truth is that an average young Nigerian has a mentality to
go to school, study well then look for a well paying job. Nobody is
thinking of how to create a job and that is why there will always
be no job for the job seekers. You know it beats me that here it is
becoming the norm to find whole families where virtually every
member of that family is unemployed, not because they don’t have
qualified people in that family but they just can not get
employment. I believe there are so many opportunities in this
country, once you get out of the mindset of getting jobs or
‘just opening a shop and selling
things'. People need to be innovative; seriously
we have a lot of entrepreneurial drive in this country, far more
than any other sub-Saharan black nation. Let me give you some
wisdom now that there is no job, this is an opportunity for you to
