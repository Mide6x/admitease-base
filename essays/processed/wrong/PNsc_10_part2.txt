planting. Anibaba cited some portions of the Holy Quran, the Holy
Bible and some traditional
dieties which gave strong backing to the support of tree
planting and environmental protection.
Dr Saka Jimoh from the University of Ibadan (UI) who represented
Professor Musiliu Onilude of the Department of Agricultural
Engineering said that tree planting should not be left to
government alone. Jimoh who demonstrated the practical method of
planting trees to participants in the campaign, presented two
species the Terminalia Montalis and the Queens Palm for planting.
He explained that the Terminalia Montalis was good for open
fields and front of houses only and should not be planted on road
medians.  He however recommended the Queens Palm which the Speaker
planted for road medians as it was shallow rooted and its roots
would not spread nor penetrate deep to destroy underground cables.
Mrs Kemi Nelson an Action Congress (AC) Leader in the state
urged participants in the campaign "to show more love and
passion for the environment" by making it a duty to ensure
they nurtured the trees they planted.
