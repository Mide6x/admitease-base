bargaining power there. Price for suit at most shopping malls
begins at N25, 000. Those who sell below that will always tell you
that they do it as a form of sales promotion. If you have a good
bargaining power, you can equally get a good suit for much less in
some markets.
The basic four
•The standard blue:
Great for business, lunch, dinner or casual parties. It can be
worn with black or brown shoes, even white if you are daring. It
reflects well by a pool. Standard blue means navy, with no room for
paler shades.
•The classic gray:
Appropriate for everything and even makes a red-head look dandy.
Grays are also the best with patterns, especially anything in the
chevron family. Start with plain, move to window-pane. Even such,
the gray is never controversial. It is the Switzerland of suits.
•The basic black:
Our favourite and the perennial classic; it is a fit at the
Oscars or your sister’s wedding, the perfect compliment to a good
white shirt, beloved by gangsters, designers and undertakers (those
jobs with the highest doses of fashion-conscious aptitudes;
respectability, aggression, vanity, and wisdom). If you only own
one suit, this is it. You can even be buried in it.
•Any of the above, with pinstripes.
