I love you or sorry, etc. I appreciate what Gerald Anthony wrote on
the topic, ‘How to be a good father’,
when he said: "It’s a sort of a cliché that fathers are
proud of their children... but a lot of fathers don’t realize how
important it is to actually tell their kids, not just their friends
and co-workers! Your kids need to know that you’re proud of them
for ... and the things that they do that you show them you’re proud
of are the things they will try to do again. If you show them that
you are proud of their good grades, they will try to get good
grades ... if you show them that you are proud of them being a good
person, or good with their siblings, or something else, they will
do whatever it is that made you proud again (or at least
try)."
To be a good dad, we must value self-improvement. When I speak
in relationship meetings, I categorically say that mega few men
read books on relationship. When you see men with books, over 80
per cent of the time, it’s a book on finance - how to make more
money. I believe that the worst way to learn a thing is through
experience. Truly, we don’t know things by default, we are created
to learn to know. There is a need for every dad to pick a book on
how to properly raise their children, read it and act on the
instructions given.
