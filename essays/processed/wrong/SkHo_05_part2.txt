of how fair their teacher is, they would be pretty accurate. You
can use this information to your advantage by creating end of the
year surveys for your own use. An end of the year survey is one
that has all students answer questions you create that are meant to
help you become a better teacher for future classes. They can be
very informative though you will of course have to remember to take
all answers without being too sensitive. Some students will
lavishly praise you in the hopes of a better final grade while
others might be tough on you - especially if they got in trouble or
had poor grades. Nonetheless, you will be able to see an
undercurrent of truth if you look at all the answers together. They
can also provide insight into improving lessons for the next
year.
Following are some possible questions you might use in your
survey:
• What was your favorite topic covered this year?
• What was your favorite lesson overall?
• What was your least favorite topic covered this year?
• What was your least favorite lesson overall?
• What suggestions do you have for your teacher to help increase
communication with students?
• What suggestions do you have for your teacher to make the
class more effective next year?
• Name 3 positive aspects of your class.
• Name 3 negative aspects of your class.
• Any further suggestion?
By giving students the ability to provide you with feedback, you
will have information that if used wisely can help you to become a
better, more effective teacher in the future.
