Saving Africa's Witch
Children'. The documentary, which won the
prestigious BAFTA and Amnesty Film awards highlights the role that
Helen Ukpabio has played in spreading the belief in child
'witches' in South-Eastern
Nigeria.
Teachings such as the one offered by Helen Ukpabio in her book,
Unveiling the Mysteries of Witchcraft, which states that: “a child
under two years of age that cries at night and deteriorates in
health is an agent of Satan”, have caused wide spread international
outrage and condemnation of her practices.
