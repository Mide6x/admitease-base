the same time, many countries have boosted coverage of skilled
delivery attendance.
Ensuring that skilled personnel are present at all deliveries
and that these personnel have access to emergency care where
necessary is the most effective means of saving the lives of
mothers.
However the pace of progress towards reaching the Millennium
Development Goal on maternal health, which calls for a 75 per cent
reduction in the maternal mortality ration between 1990 and 2015,
has been too slow throughout the developing world and must now be
accelerated if the goal is to be reached.
To achieve the MDG target, maternal health must be addressed as
part of a continuum of care that connects essential maternal,
newborn and child health services.
Indeed, levels of maternal mortality often reflect the overall
performance of a country’s national health system – particularly
during delivery and in the postnatal period, when mothers and
newborns are most vulnerable.
To fill this critical gap, services that benefit both mother and
child need to be scaled up, as the health of the mother is closely
linked to that of her newborn.
“Saving mothers’ lives is not only a moral imperative,
but a sound investment that benefits their children, their
families, their communities and their countries,” said
Tessa Wardlaw, UNICEF’s Chief of Statistics and Monitoring.
“Indeed, there is a clear connection between maternal
health and other Millennium Development Goals, such as eradicating
extreme poverty, reducing child mortality, and combating HIV and
AIDS and other diseases.”
