congregation. It is time for the youths of Nigeria to speak out
their voice and stair this great
nation in the right path to go, the ability lies in our hands to do
this, in addition I have a piece of advice for youths, look for a
quiet place, sit down and think, about your abilities, there is
something God deposited in you to excel, you are unique and there
is no two of your kind on earth ,
its just you with those special abilities, if
I may ask , is there anyone who
has the same finger print with another
,definitely NO  Same apply to your
ability, search Deeply there is something about you. I would
continue with the second series next two weeks, if you have any
comments or suggestions mail me on
