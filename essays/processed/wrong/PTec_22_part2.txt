our dealers’ investment as well as a confidence boost for our
numerous customers in the ability of our stations to meet their
petroleum product demands all year round irrespective of
geographical location.
"Once again, we are proud to pioneer this initiative in
Nigeria, as we continue to maintain retail market leadership with
innovative products and services."
Oando Marketing also recently broke new ground with another
customer value-adding initiative with the launch of Oando
Pay-As-U-Gas which involves dispensing of Liquefied Petroleum Gas
(LPG) into the customers’ cylinders using a metered pump, right
there on the station forecourt.
The benefits of the Pay-As-U-Gas initiative to customers include
flexibility, product integrity, convenience and expert after sales
service whilst allowing the customer to retain physical possession
of their cylinder. This service is currently obtainable from
designated service stations in Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna.
"Oando Marketing Limited is the nation’s leading oil
retailer, with one in every five litres of petroleum products being
sold or distributed via Oando’s over 500 retail outlets and
strategically located terminals whilst ensuring continuous products
supply and availability in Nigeria and the West African sub region
including Ghana, Togo and Benin," the statement added.
