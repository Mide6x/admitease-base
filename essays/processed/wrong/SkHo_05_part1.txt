Activities to Round Off the Session
Veteran teachers know well the difficulties of school’s final
weeks. Students’ minds are on vacation, grades have been earned and
recorded, books must be collected, and resources ordered. Adding to
those problems is the fact many schools want you packed and ready
to vacate your room for cleaning or moving. Plus, planning
graduation events and looking for employment in other schools
create a high level of stress for teachers.
Remembering closure is a learning experience, consider having
students organize their notes and review what they’ve learned in
the form of a play or scrapbook. In addition, have them predict
their future and place their prediction in an essay form which they
can keep safely and refer to in the future.
Although some of the following ideas may be young for secondary
school, they can be modified by adjusting the materials. For
example, a secondary school English student could write a poem
about their future in the style of an individual studied. Another
student could write a fictional account of a future leader based on
character traits of those studied. In other words, if students are
motivated, the end of the year can be a large, organized and
relaxed time.
Other ideas include:
· Create a summer safety poster.
· Make autograph books.
· Write an ode to the classroom.
· Write a letter to next year’s class.
· Make a memory or scrapbook to use next year.
· Create a words-of-wisdom poster for next year’s students.
· Write a letter to next year’s teacher.
· Have students use a large sheet of butcher paper or bulletin
board paper to create a timeline listing what they learned this
year.
· Create a play that tells the story of the year.
· Finally, make sure you use all that student energy to help you
clean and prepare the classroom for next year.
End of Year Teacher Survey
Students are very perceptive. If you walked into any
teacher's classroom and asked students for an honest opinion
