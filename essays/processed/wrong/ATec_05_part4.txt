lift(L) depends on the viscosity of the liquid ( μ )
), its density ( ρ )
submergence
depth(Hd), actual liquid
static depth(Hs), diameter of
pipe(d) and injection
pressure(P). In other words,
L= f ( μ , ρ , Hd, Hs, d, P). Using Dimensional Analysis a relation
was developed as LDN =f( PDN) where,
From Table 3 generated from the experiments a logarithmic plot
of LDN against PDN was obtained as shown in Figure 5. The slope of
the graph was obtained as 0.22 while the intercept of the
graph was obtained as -0.76 (for the best line of fit). This
yielded a relation LDN = 0.17PDN0.22
CONCLUSION
From all of the above it can be established that pipe size,
configuration, submergence, air pressure and fluid type determine
to a considerable extent the maximum lift produced by an air lift
pump. It has also established the possibility of using
dimensionless relations to characterise the pump
