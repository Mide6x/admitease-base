directivity function of the transmitting and receiving antenna
systems, and are calculated in terms of their effective area.
σbi is the bistatic
scattering cross section which is defined as the scattering cross
section per unit volume of precipitation. It is related to the
radar reflectivity factor Z and the point rain
rate R as Z = 10log
z , where z =
aRb . In this study,
we assumed the tropical lognormal raindrops size distribution of
Ajayi and Olsen (1985), and since the distribution fits the
convective thunderstorm rain type very well, we have assumed the
Z-R relationship proposed by Ajayi and Owolabi,
(1987) for tropical thunderstorm rain in the study in which
a = 461 and b =1.31
respectively.
This study covers the frequency range 4–35 GHz used presently by
most service providers for terrestrial and Earth-space
communications. The mean annual cumulative distribution of point
rain rate P(R) measured at the three locations
are used to predict interference levels with the probability of
occurrence ranging from 1-10-3%.
The attenuation of the signals due to rain was evaluated using
the Power law relationship between attenuation and rain rate, while
attenuation due to atmospheric gases was calculated using the ITU-R
Rec. 676-3 (1997). The parameters of the power law
relationship for attenuation by thunderstorm rain valid for
tropical locations employed in the study are shown in Table 1 for
vertically polarized signals only.
