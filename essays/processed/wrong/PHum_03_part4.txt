According to him, “Let's dance” teaches viewers, especially
in these modern times when traditional things seem to no longer
hold attraction for many, that dance is part of our cultural
expression and the show has also revealed that Nigerians love
dancing.
"Let's Dance" provides a unique platform to
showcase the richness of our culture, it provides an opportunity
for togetherness, while they work to master their own.
On this note, I am telling Nigerians that we are losing; we are

“Your art is expected to market your products. Let me use this

“If Tu-Face were to wear the Abeokuta Adire or the Ange of the
Tiv people or the other version of Ange of the Idoma people, the
one with the red and black stripes to perform in Tokyo, the
Japanese will start wearing our native fabrics because they are

start earning foreign currency from the acts of Tu-Face. This is
what art is supposed to do for people.

the American textile industry to grow while helping to kill the
Nigerian textile industry.
