How to be a good dad to your children
COMMENTS by some children about their father are disheartening.
You will hear them talk about the head of the home as someone who
hasn’t been there for them. A father who is never around; a good
man to everyone but his own. To some children, daddy is the
greatest. He buys whatever they ask for, and pampers them with
gifts. He saves them from mummy’s spanking. That daddy will always
be on my side is the confidence some children have.
I counseled a lady recently who was concerned about her
children’s behaviour. They seem to be going wild by the day, and
she’s loosing control over them; thanks to their dad. She said he
would not allow her discipline them. If she did that when he was
not at home, the children would report her to him when she came
back home and all hell would be let loose. She had tried to talk
him into seeing the negative effect of his actions to no avail. So,
to the children, dad is the greatest while mummy is a bully.
There is a need to redefine the word ‘good’ if we will be effective
fathers. The word ‘good’ isn’t synonymous to
letting your children have their way. It’s not when your children
call you good that you are one, but when deep in your heart, you
know that you have trained them to be better people for their own
sake and to live a purposeful life. Being a good dad is not about
what you do but who you are. So, if we fathers learn to work on
ourselves, we can effectively reach our children even though at
present, they may not like some of the instructions and reprimands
we give them (just as in the days of our parents when we felt that
they were too harsh on us).
To be a good dad, we must learn to control our emotions, one of
which is anger. Our children will sometimes provoke us, but
