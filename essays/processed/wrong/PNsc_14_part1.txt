Cervical Cancer, The Silent Killer
Cancer is an umbrella term for more than 100 life-threatening
diseases characterized by the uncontrolled, abnormal growth of
malignant cells. These harmful cells may spread locally to adjacent
tissues or to other locations in the body through the bloodstream
or lymphatic system. Cancer may affect people at all ages, but the
risk for most varieties increases with age. Cancer causes about 13%
of all deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, 7.6
million people died from cancer in the world during 2007.
Cervical cancer has been proven to be due to a virus called the
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Global prevalence of HPV in cervical
carcinoma is 99.7%. Over 100 types of HPV have been
discovered with at least 13 genotypes associated with cancer. The
eight most common high-risk genotypes (HPV 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52,
58 and 35) account for 90% of cases of cervical cancer. Apart from
HPV 16 and 18, each individual genotype causes a small (5%)
proportion of cases. HPV 16 and 18 account for more than 70% of all
cervical cancers in the world. HPV 31 and 45 are implicated in
about 4% of the cases. The low risk HPV genotypes can cause genital
warts or low-grade lesions on the cervical surface. Between 90% and
100% of genital warts are caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 11.
Worldwide, cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer related
morbidity and mortality in women. It continues to be the second
commonest female cancer worldwide after breast carcinoma. The
prevalence of genital HPV infection in the world is around 440
million. It is estimated that there were almost 260 000 deaths from
cervical cancer in 2005, and 2.7 million years of life lost.
About 500 000 cases of cervical cancer are estimated to occur each
year and over 80% of which occur in developing countries, where
neither population-based routine screening nor optimal treatment is
available. The highest estimated incidence rates of cervical cancer
occur in Africa, Central and South America and Asia. In Nigeria,
