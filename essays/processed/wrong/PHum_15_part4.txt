arts. “The government should be serious with the Endowment Fund for
the arts. The government should be disposed to the arts and
properly educate the populace about this.”

sincere in whatever you are doing. There is much to be achieved in
this country. They should be hard working and look at what they
should offer the country and not necessarily what the country
should do for them.”
