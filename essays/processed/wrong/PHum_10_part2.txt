the past, exhibitions were planned and executed by purely museum
professionals who select and mount objects. But quite recently
cooperate bodies, NGOs and the general publics have contributed to
the success of some museum exhibitions.
In Lagos museum, for instance, one of the temporary exhibitions
titled, All is not lost, is a product of
collaboration with the Ford Foundation.
The involvement of the public in museum matters has gone a long
way in bringing out the best in museum practices, especially the
selection of objects to be exhibited. Nigeria, being a
multi-cultural nation, has one of the greatest collections of
objects in the world. Some of the objects in the museums show the
similarities in the culture of Nigerian people, which is an
indication of brotherhood.
Theodore Low said it all when he wrote, "no one can
deny that museums have powers which are of the utmost importance in
any war of ideologies. They have power to make people see the
truth, the power to make people recognise the importance of
individuals as members of society, and of equal importance in
combating subversive inroads, the power to keep minds happy and
healthyâ€¦..Museums with their potentiality of reaching millions of
our citizens must not fail to recognise their
responsibility."
In conclusion, now that the museum has extended its hands for
public collaboration, the ball is now in the court of the public
who is expected to rise up to the challenges, so that the interest
of all will be taken care of.
