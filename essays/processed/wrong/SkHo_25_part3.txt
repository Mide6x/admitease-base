Or are you a Business Owner? These are risk bearers, individuals
with good leadership qualities and great drive with the ability to
set up a good system that works. They may be but not necessarily
professionals or graduates but they surround themselves with
competent people. The business owner‘s skills are not usually
taught in schools and that is why some of the wealthiest people on
earth have quit school to become very successful businessmen. They
love to delegate duties and are willing to pay for services
rendered. The personnel they hire could come from any or all the
categories. They are not afraid to bear the risk of investing in
their own business.
Then there are The Investors: This is the rich man‘s playground
where money works to make money. They are not the typical 9-5 men
or the very ‘hard working’ type. They
are already done with that. What distinguishes them from the others
is their readiness to take investment risks that some others would
never contemplate. If you hope to be rich one day, no matter which
of the above categories you make your money from, you will
ultimately need to get here. This is the place of extreme financial
freedom. The place I would love to be!
