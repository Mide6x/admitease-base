Secondary prevention is done through screening and treatment of
identified pre-cancerous lesions. Screening methods includes Pap
Smear, Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid, Visual Inspection with
Lugol’s Iodine, HPV DNA Testing, Hybrid Capture® 2 Test (HC-2) and
The Fast HPV test. Pap smear screening in developed countries have
contributed to an 80% reduction of the incidence of cervical
cancer. Hysterectomy, Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy are mostly used
as tertiary intervention.
According to World Health Organization, preliminary data show
that HPV vaccination may be cost-effective in developing countries.
Currently, in Uganda, Programme for Appropriate Technology in
Health (PATH) in close collaboration with the local Ministry of
Health and other partners are piloting HPV vaccine introduction.
The piloting has also been carried out in India, Vietnam and Peru.
The governments of developing countries including Nigeria need
cancer policies and step up media enlightenment in the fight
against cervical cancer which is not only health concerns but
social, economic, and psychological burdens. Operation Stop
Cervical Cancer Nigeria (SCCAN) and other relevant organizations
should join hands in preventing cervical cancer in Nigerian
women.
