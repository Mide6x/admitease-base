a high, it contracts with the high tomorph and so the effect of the
relinking is vacuous. Let us consider some examples:
The future tense
In its full form, the future tense is marked segmentally by a
particle, which occurs between the subject noun phrase and the verb
stem of the clause. This particle is realised in two phonological
shapes /che/ and /cha/ depending on the vowel harmony requirement
of the verb stem vowel. If the verb stem vowel is [-(-ART], it
selects /che/ and if it is [-ART], it selects /cha/. This future
tense is used to indicate an action that is yet to commence or one
that is being contemplated.
Tonally, the future tense construction is marked by a H - L - H
tone sequence which is distributed as follows:
a) the first high tone is segmentalised on the final vowel of
the subject noun phrase (or the only vowel segment of a
monosyllabic subject pronoun).
b) the low tone is mapped onto the future tense particle, and
c) the second high tone is mapped onto the only or first vowel
of the verb stem and spreads onto any following vowel segment
within the verb stem; hence, all verb stem vowels are realised as
high. We shall consider some examples:
The examples above show that tonal alternations in this
construction result from the segmentalisation of the two high tones
marking the future tense. The segmentalisation of the first high
tone onto the subject NP results in the automatic delinking of the
inherent or lexical tone in that position if it is low. (This is
unlike what happens with the present tomorph whose segmentalisation
results in the lengthening of the final vowel of the subject NP so
as to accommodate the tomorph.) The second high tone of the future
tense spreads onto other vowel segments within the verb stem if the
verb stem is other than monosyllabic. It is unlike the past tense
tomorph, which does not spread. However like the past tense
tomorph, if the final vowel of the verb stem is elided or becomes a
