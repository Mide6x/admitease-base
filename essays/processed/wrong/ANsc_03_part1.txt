Effect of heat processing on the proximate composition and
energy values of selected Nigerian staple foods from oil-producing
areas of the Niger Delta
Abstract
Proximate composition and energy values of four raw and heat
processed staple foods (yams, cassava, cocoyam and maize) from
oil-producing (Eleme, Ogoni, Okrika, and Nembe) areas of Rivers and
Bayelsa States and Abakaliki (a non-oil producing area in Ebonyi
State, Nigeria) as control were investigated. In raw yam tubers,
moisture was high in all the locations and ranged from 61.96
+ 0.02% in Abakaliki to 63.77+0.25% in Ogoni.
Crude protein ranged from 1.39+0.13% in Okrika to
1.71+0.06% in Abakaliki while ash was highest (2.57+0.12%) in Okrika followed by 2.33+0.01%
in Eleme and was lowest (0.97+0.06%) in Abakaliki.
Crude fat was low in all the locations and ranged from 0.10+0.00% in Okrika to 0.17+0.01% in Nembe
while total carbohydrate was high in all the locations ranging from
33.32+0.42% in Ogoni to 35.21+0.13% in
Abakaliki. The calorific value (kcal/100 g sample) in all the
locations was low. It was highest (149.08) in yams from
Abakaliki followed by Eleme (142.55) and lowest in Ogoni
(140.09). Similar trends in values of the constituents were
obtained in raw cassava, cocoyam and maize from different
oil-producing and control locations investigated. In each of these
locations, heat processing generally increased moisture content of
all the samples (yam, cassava products, cocoyam and maize), but
decreased dry matter, crude protein, ash, crude fat, total
carbohydrate and calorific value. With the exception of moisture
and ash, other nutrients were significantly (p<0.05)
higher in the control area of Abakaliki than values obtained in
similar samples from oil producing areas of the Niger Delta
investigated
INTRODUCTION
In Nigeria, there are 36 States and the Federal Capital
Territory, Abuja divided into six geopolitical zones (Northeast,
Northwest, Northcentral, Southeast, Southwest and South south
) Rivers and Bayelsa in the
Southsouth zone are two of the states in oil-producing areas of the
Niger Delta, Nigeria where staple foods such as yam, cassava,
cocoyam and maize are abundant, though the staples are seasonal.
Oil-producing areas (Eleme, Ogoni, Okrika and Nembe) are fraught
