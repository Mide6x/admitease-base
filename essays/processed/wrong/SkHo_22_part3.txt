real areas where the two of you can work together. Quick tip: your
customer knows that you’re telling the truth when you’re not afraid
where to say something negative (the true) about your product or
company.
Keep an open mind
. When you walk into a customer meeting
absolutely convinced that the customer needs your product or
service, the customer will sense you’re close-minded and become
close-minded in return. If, by contrast, you’re open to the idea
that the customer might be better served elsewhere, the customer
will sense that you’ve got his or her best interests at heart and
will be more likely to listen to what you have to
say.
Have a real dialogue. A customer meeting
should be a conversation, not a mere sales call. This means that
you should be listening to the customer at least half of the time
that’s spent at the meeting. Furthermore, the dialogue should be
substantive and about real business issues, not just office patter
or chit-chat about sport.
Step five: Maintain and deepen relationships with
inexpensive, thoughtful acts
A good way to show that you care about people is to notice their
interests and then fine small ways
to make them happy. For example, suppose your best customer is a
big football fan. You might call up the local newspaper in your
area (where the team is based) and arrange to have the Sunday
sports section sent to that customer each week. In some cases, a
simple telephone call when you’re in the area – even if you don’t
have time to visit that customer – is enough. The key concept here
is "inexpensive." You want to show that you care, not
make the customer feel obligated to buy.
