inguinal hernia. The hernia may look like a bulge or swelling in
the groin area. It can be corrected with surgery.
Disorders of the Penis
Disorders affecting the penis include:
•Inflammation of the penis.
Symptoms of penile inflammation include redness, itching,
swelling, and pain. Balanitis occurs when the glans (the head of
the penis) becomes inflamed. Posthitis is foreskin inflammation,
which is usually due to a yeast or bacterial infection.
•Hypospadias.
This is a disorder in which the urethra opens on the underside
of the penis, not at the tip.
•Phimosis.
This is a tightness of the foreskin of the penis and is common
in newborns and young children. It usually resolves itself without
treatment. If it interferes with urination, circumcision (removal
of the foreskin) may be recommended.
•Paraphimosis.
This may develop when a boy’s uncircumcised penis is retracted
but doesn’t return to the unretracted position. As a result, blood
flow to the head of the penis may be impaired, and your son may
experience pain and swelling. A doctor may use lubricant to make a
small incision so the foreskin can be pulled forward. If that
doesn’t work, circumcision may be recommended.
•Ambiguous genitalia.
This occurs when a child is born with genitals that aren’t
clearly male or female. In most boys born with this disorder, the
penis may be very small or nonexistent, but testicular tissue is
present. In a small number of cases, the child may have both
testicular and ovarian tissue.
•Micropenis.
This is a disorder in which the penis, although normally formed,
is well below the average size, as determined by standard
measurements.
