Using this example it is easy to see that the “topology” of
human trade routes and living patterns guides so much
“infrastructure” development. Telecom development follows these
patterns to the degree that they must but there are two
externalities that have significantly distorted the evolution of
telecom. First, there is regulation.
The development of cities, settled areas, roads and trade routes
were largely subject to the kind of narrowly focused grants of
monopoly seen in telecom. Secondly, the use of technology to
attempt to “by pass” small and
large blocks of humanity in order to communicate across, over,
around and through them is somewhat unique to telecom.
The combination of wireless technology and Africa is often
painted as a logically synergistic combination. Large areas that
have historically been poorly served by dysfunction monopoly PTTs,
poverty that argues for a cheap and “quick fix” solution.
I often hear arguments to the effect that “since Africa is
different” …a different approach logically follows. As long as the
first postulate goes unchallenged the second assertion gets an
intellectual free ride that it does not deserve.
In making the case for fiber in Africa I’d like to argue that
Africa is *not* different and that the Africa we see today proves
that, if we’d only see it with open eyes.
It would be a tragedy to not apply lessons from other parts of
the world which could be used to make Africa
telecom_rich simply because
of a mistaken notion that somehow Africa is “different” and has to
underwrite a costly discovery of its own rules.“
