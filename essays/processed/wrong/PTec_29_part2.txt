seats, a moon roof, wood-tone accents and, on the V6 model, leather
seating.
Note that neither the SE nor the XLE offers the folding rear
seat, though each has a center pass-through.
Most of the XLEâ€™s upgrades are offered on the lower trim levels
as options.
Other major options, depending on trim level, include a sunroof,
a navigation system, keyless ignition and entry and heated front
seats.
All Camrys are front-wheel drive, and the standard engine on
base, LE and XLE trim levels is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder
that generates 169 hp, 11 more than the previous 2.4-liter
four.
Optional on all models except for the base Camry is a 3.5-liter V6 that cranks out 268 horse power and 248 lb-ft of
torque. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission choice.
