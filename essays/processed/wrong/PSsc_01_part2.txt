MEDICON Executive Director, said parents and guardians needs to
educate both boys and girls about sex.
“Some parents don’t want to talk about sex education and this is
a subject that needs to be arrested. They have to teach them about
issues of sexuality, because these children are being expose to
different images through the television and newspapers.
Parents have the responsibility of telling them the consequences
of what they are viewing not being harsh or scolding such a child
will save the situation.”
