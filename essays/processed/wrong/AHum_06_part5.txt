glide, this tomorph obligatorily relinks and the result is
automatic delinking of a following inherent tone. In each case, the
effect of segmentalisation is vacuous if the inherent tone is also
a high.
Negation and interrogation
Negation in Urhobo is marked by a floating L H tone sequence,
which is mapped onto the final vowel in the phonetic realisation.
In order to accommodate the tone sequence, the final vowel is
lengthened. In the orthography this is represented by doubling the
final vowel. Thus we have the following:
On the other hand, interrogation is marked by a floating low
tone, which is realised on the final vowel of the utterance. If the
statement already ends on a low tone, the addition of this question
morpheme results in our perceiving the utterance on an extra low
level. However, if the statement ends on a high tone the addition
of the question morpheme results in the creation of a HL contour
but there is no lengthening of the final vowel. The following are
some examples:
From the foregoing, it is clear that tone has both lexical and
grammatical functions in Urhobo and that it is as important, if not
even more important, than the consonant and vowel segments used in
utterances.
The need for tone-marking in the writing system
We decided to give a technical treatment to our section 3 in
order to show that tone in Urhobo is not just a matter of choice or
something that is haphazardly done but that it is a systematic
phenomenon which is well entrenched in the grammar of the language.
Tone can differentiate the meaning of words as well as distinguish
different grammatical constructions.
A number of people object to the use of tone marks in writing
simply because it is not used in English and so they consider it
untidy. They seem to forget that English is not a tone language in
the sense that Urhobo is. Whether you say
'clear' with a high, mid or low tone,
the meaning is the same in English. But as we have seen, a change
