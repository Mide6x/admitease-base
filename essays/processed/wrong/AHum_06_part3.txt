high tone, it is easy to perceive a lengthening of both the high
tone and the final vowel. If on the other hand, if the subject NP
ends on a low tone, the present tense tomorph is segmentalised on
the lengthened portion of the final vowel. We said earlier that
when the subject pronoun or verb is not bearing a tomorph, it is
realised on a low tone. Consequently, if the subject NP is a
pronoun, the first part of the vowel bears a low tone while the
lengthened portion bears the high tone. Let us examine some
examples. (Note: pr.t= present tomorph.)
The past tense
In the full form of the past tense, the verb appears with a
suffix, which is realised in two phonological shapes depending on
the vowel harmony requirements of the verb stem vowel. (Vowels in
this language fall into two groups with regard to vowel harmony and
the harmony feature is the Advanced Tongue Root [ATR]).
Consequently, the vowels /i, e, o, u,/ are [+ATR] while /แบน, a, o/
are [-ART]. For a detailed discussion of vowel harmony in Urhobo,
see Aziza (1994, 1997)). The
alternating forms of the verb suffix are - ri and re. If the verb
stem vowel is [+ ATR], it takes the suffix -ri but if the verb stem
is [-ATR], it takes -re. This suffix occurs only when the verb is
not followed by an object; where it is, the suffix is deleted.
As for tonal alternation, the past tense construction assigns a
high tomorph, which is segmentalised on the only vowel segment of a
monosyllabic verb stem or on the final vowel of a disyllabic verb
stem. When the verb stem is followed by a noun object, the final
vowel of the verb stem is either elided or undergoes glide
formation resulting in the past tense tomorph being set afloat.
Since it is a grammatical tone, it obligatory relinks on the prefix
vowel of the following noun object resulting in the delinking of
the lexical tone in that position if it is a low. However if it is
