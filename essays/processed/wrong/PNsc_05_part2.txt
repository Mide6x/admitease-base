often, an infected person may not be aware of having the infection,
because he or she may not have any serious symptoms initially.
Sometimes a victim may be having some common ailments, which he or
she may just overlook as just an ordinary or common sickness. A
very good example of this is someone having a recurrent malaria or
typhoid fever, which always return after few weeks of treatment.
The funny thing about this situation is that when such people go to
the hospital or laboratory for test, all that will be revealed is
that they are malaria parasite positive. Such people will continue
wasting their hard-earned money on treating malaria without any
appreciable result. In some cases a victim of staph may not have
any defined symptom, but such a person will feel unwell, restless,
and constant headache. When such person goes to hospital for
medical check up, nothing will be revealed and
such a person is said to be medically fit. But within themselves
they know that they are not okay. A good example is a patient after
reading our article on staphylococcus infection and the symptoms,
came to our office to complain that he has been to different
hospitals for various tests which all revealed nothing. After
carrying out some series of tests on him in our office, he was
diagnosed to be having a heavy growth of staph. aureus and
he was treated and today he is staph free and a happy man.
I can tell you with every assurance that you too can be free
from staph or any kind of ailment that have defied those orthodox
treatment and I assure you that contacting us at Sound Health
Centre will make you thank God at the end of the day. Why should
you continue wasting your hard earn resource on what does not help.
I expect to receive your call or visit any of our offices. Those
outside Lagos can also benefit from our services, just call and we
will tell you what to do. See you next week herein.
