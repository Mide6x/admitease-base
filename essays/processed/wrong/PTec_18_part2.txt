preferred way of building a website. By using various plugins, it’s
possible to do pretty well anything you want.
=== What Are “Plugins”? ===
Plugins are extra features available for your blog to make your
life easier. You can get plugins, for example, that will:
- help you block spam
- make it easy to upload and sort your photos
- ping the search engines so they know when you’ve added new
content
- insert Adsense blocks so you can earn money from your blog
There are quite a number of plugins available now - take some
time to find out what they will do.
=== Help With Using Wordpress ===
While Wordpress is not the only blog software available, it is
an excellent choice because (a) it’s free; (b) it’s relatively easy
to use; (c) it’s open-source, and therefore has a lot of people
working on it constantly to make it better, and (d) there are quite
a few ‘how to’ sites on the Internet
showing you how to make the most of your Wordpress blog.
One of them is Guido Stiehle (”The Jungle Marketer”) who offers
an excellent free tutorial (with video tutorials) that will show
you, step by step, how to set up and use your blog. You can find
other providers by simply typing ‘how to use
Wordpress’ into a search engine.
Spend an hour or two browsing, and you’ll see why a blog is a
very viable option for establishing your presence on the
Internet.
