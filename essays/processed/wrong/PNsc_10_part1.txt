Rt. Hon Adeyemi Ikuforiji  Speaker of the Lagos State
House of Assembly, called on residents of Lagos to imbibe the habit
of planting trees to preserve the environment on Tuesday.
Ikuforji made the call at the year 2009 tree planting campaign

behalf of the state governor, Mr Babatunde Fashola to plant trees
on the road. Answering questions from newsman after planting a
tree, the speaker urged residents of the state to ensure that the
dream of the state government towards a green environment was
sustained.
"it should not be a one off
thing but some thing we do every day. We need to protect our
environment we all see what is happening. How much of rainfall have
we had this year?
"We have already had more than we should for the entire
period. The global warming is real and we need to protect our
environment. "If we all get used to the idea, there may not be
need to get special people to take care of the plants as people
around would get used to the habit," he said.
The speaker while delivering his welcome address stressed the
state governmentâ€™s commitment "to bring back as much greenery
as possible" to ensure a safe and healthy environment.
Stressing the importance of trees, he said that trees had been
scientifically proven to fight global warming as it absorbed carbon
dioxide to replenish oxygen.
He explained that the state was careful to preserve trees
planted during its inaugural tree planting campaign last year by
taking a census of the trees planted in Ikeja, Apapa and Ikoyi. He
added that 3088 were counted in the three zones. He urged residents
of the state to "join hands in protecting existing trees at
every given opportunity" and make tree planting a culture.
