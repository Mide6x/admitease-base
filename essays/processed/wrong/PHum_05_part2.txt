Marlon Jackson. But, it was not until last year,
. Ajose said, when Marlon Jackson
had earlier visited the slave route on March 7th, 2008, he was so
moved that he ‘felt’ this had to be the
place he came from. "I have a feeling I am from here,"
Ajose reported Malon as saying. Subsequently, the Ifa Oracle was
consulted and it was found out that
that the Jackson family came from Badagry. And ‘Ajaneson’, from a Vothun Priest
family which bears that name.
Hence, it is based on Marlon’s sense of
de javu and Ifa divinations that
the 2009 ceremony sponsored by the Badagry Local Government,
Tourism Arts and Culture Network, Badagry (TACnet), African
Renaissance Foundation (AREFO), Ijinla Arts and Tours, and the
Motherland Group LLC holds. The Motherland group which has Marlon
Jackson, Gary Loster
The theme of this year’s celebration is ‘Family
Re-union’. Scheduled to hold between August 21st and
29th, there will be picnics, symposia, speeches and dramas. On the
22nd, there would be a candlelight procession to mark the 1791
night of revolt, Vothun Festival at Ajara, African Arts exhibition,
Zamgbetto Festival, Boat Reggata, and the final burial rites for
the repose of the soul of Michael Jackson. It is paradoxical that
Michael Jackson was planning to come and perform at Badagry before
his death.
For the burial rites, a chief priest of Vothun, Chief Zannu
Awhanvoyetho said Jackson’s yoko (earth taken
from his grave) would be taken and brought to Badagry to be rested
in his yoho, (the building where the earth would
be committed). Other rites would then be performed. And Ajose said,
permission for this has been asked and granted by the Jackson
family.
The Motherland Group has commenced the building of a museum
where memorabilia of Michael Jackson will be stored.
