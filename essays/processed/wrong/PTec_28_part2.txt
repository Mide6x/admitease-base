adjustment for the seat and a tilt and telescopic steering column.
The latter is a rarity in the Cerato’s price segment.
Powering the Cerato’s front wheels is the same1.6-litre
four-cylinder motor from the previous Cerato. The 1591cc unit makes
a pretty healthy 124bhp, making it one of the most powerful cars in
the 1.6-litre class.
Performance is sufficient if not brisk. Kia quotes a 0-100km/h
time of 12 seconds dead for the four-speed automatic model tested
here. Out on the road, the engine is a willing performer, offering
a nice spread of torque at all speeds. Refinement is not its
particular ‘forte’ though as it can
sound a tad harsh when worked hard.
The four-speed automatic gearbox is fast shifting and efficient
enough but the lack of an additional ratio or two will ultimately
hurt performance and fuel economy a tad. On the upside, it offers a
‘+/-‘manual mode that ought to satisfy keener drivers.
Despite its relatively simple struts and torsion beam suspension
set-up, the Cerato offers a well-damped and comfortable ride. In
fact, its impressive ride quality feels like that of a bigger
model’s body control in the corners is decent as well and
electronic stability control is a standard feature on the model
available here.
A major letdown of this car’s dynamics is the steering. The
electro-hydraulic assisted helm offers little feels and worse
still, its self-centering feels too artificial for it to be a
rewarding drive.
The engine offers sufficient performance while there is a nice
fancy feel to the way it rides. Other than the steering and the
slightly hard materials in the cabin, there is hardly anything to
nitpick in the Cerato.
