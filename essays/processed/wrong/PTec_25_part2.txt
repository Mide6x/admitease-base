During installation, users will be asked to validate Windows
running on your PC to make sure that it’s genuine. Genuine Windows
is the umbrella label for several of the company’s anti-piracy
technologies, including product activation and the often-criticized
validation and notification components, which regularly determine
whether the copy of Windows running on a PC is legitimate.
However, other anti malware companies, especially
Symantec
has continued reacting to the release of MSE. They believe
Microsoft was not known for security and that their newly release
antivirus software might not stand the test of time. Symantec
referred to the Security Essentials as a rerun of Windows Live One
Care, security software from Microsoft, which is now defunct.
Symantec also holds that MSE was made pro bono by Microsoft
because of its inferior quality and incapability of fighting
viruses to the finish.
As to the rationale of offering MSE at no cost, Microsoft
explained that that was done because they believe many of their
customers worldwide that do not have up-to-date protection either
because they cannot afford it, are concerned about the impact the
suites will have on the performance of their PCs, or because they
simply do not realize their antivirus software is not up to
date.
The software is still available for download on the Microsoft
website and from others websites that have the link of Microsoft,
and other that have been authorised to do so.
