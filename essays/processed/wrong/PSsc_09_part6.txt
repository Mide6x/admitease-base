to have a balance. Employers also have to recognise that an
employee who is happy and has a happy home would give better
performance on the job,” she said.
Bazuaye therefore advised strongly that women must not lose
focus as regard their parental responsibilities. “Parenting is not
something you can outsource, it is something you have got to do
yourself and if you don’t do it right, you would end up with
children who would turn out to be
deliquence or bad adults. So you have to inculcate the
right virtues in them so they would grow up with these things being
part of them. And living the example of what you tell your children
to do is the best way to bring up your children because they would
live it better when they see the examples in you,” she
emphasised.
