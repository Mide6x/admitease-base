The Changing Rainfall Pattern and Its Implication for 
    Flood Frequency in Makurdi, Northern Nigeria
ABSTRACT: The study deals with analysis of 
    recent changes in the characteristics of extreme rainfall and their 
    implication for flood frequency in Makurdi. Data on extreme daily 
    rainfall, evapotranspiration and flood occurrences were collected 
    for analysis. The annual rainfall was analysed for trends using 
    spearman rank correlation coefficient, annual rainfall variability 
    analysed using standardized rainfall anomaly index while recurrence 
    intervals were analysed using Gumbell Extreme probability theory. 
    The results of the analysis show among other things that there was 
    a remarkable continuous downward trend in annual rainfall amounts; 
    that the period between 1996 and 2001 witnessed the highest 
    frequencies of extreme rainfall events and flood frequencies; that 
    major floods were associated with high recurrence intervals, and 
    that the seasonally of flooding in Makurdi occurs between May and 
    October.
Increasing flood risk is now being recognized as the most 
    important sectoral threat from climate change in most parts of the 
    world. This has prompted public debate on the apparent increased 
    frequency of extreme, and in particular, on perceived increases in 
    rainfall intensities (Dyson, 2000). Several studies have adduced 
    extreme rainfall to be the major cause of flood worldwide. Such 
    studies includes Gobo (1988), McEwen (1989), Oriola (1994) Babatolu 
    (1996); FEPA (1998), Fowler and Kilsby (2003) Odekunle (2001), and 
    Ologunorisa (2001, 2004). Other studies have identified the 
    characteristics of extreme rainfall that are associated with flood 
    frequency to include duration, intensity, frequency, seasonality, 
    variability, trend and fluctuation (Olaniran, 1983; Ologunorisa, 
    2001; Ologunorisa and Diagi, 2005).
In Nigeria, studies on rainfall and their implication for flood 
    frequency have been restricted to the southern parts of Nigeria, 
    little or no attempt has been made in the literature to study the 
    implication of recent changes in rainfall pattern on flood 
    frequency in northern Nigeria despite increase frequency of floods 
    in this region, and this is where this study derives its relevance. 
    The present study attempts to examine recent changes in rainfall 
    pattern and its implication on flood frequency in a seasonally 
    flooded town of Makurdi, northern Nigeria.
Study Area: Makurdi: 
    Makurdi the administrative headquarter of Benue state, lies 
    approximately between latitude 70441N 
    and longitude 80 54JE. The town is 
    located along the coast of the River Benue. The climatic condition 
    in Makurdi is influenced by two air masses: the warm, moist south 
    westerly air mass, and the warm, dry northeasterly air mass. The 
    southwesterly airmass is a rain - bearing wind that brings about 
    rainfall from the months of May to October. The dry northeasterly 
    airmass blows over the region from November to April, thereby 
    bringing about seasonal drought. The mean annual rainfall in 
    Makurdi is about 1,290mm. (Akintola, 1986). Temperature in Makurdi 
    is however, generally high throughout the year, with February and 
    March as the hottest months. Temperature in Makurdi varies from a 
    daily of 400C and a maximum of 22.50C.
Makurdi town, like most other cities in the lower Benue valley 
    is drained by the Benue River and its tributaries. Other minor 
    rivers that drain the Makurdi town, and in turn empty their waters 
    in the River Benue includes: Rivers Idye, Genebe, Urudu, Kpege and 
    Kereke. Due to the general low relief of Makurdi, sizeable portions 
    of the area is waterlogged and flooded during heavy rainstorm 
    (FMWRRD, 1998).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Collection and Analytical Techniques: 
    The data used for this work are from secondary sources. These 
    include data on rainfall, evapotranspiration, and flood occurrence 
    in Makurdi town. The rainfall data used are of two types - annual 
    rainfall and extreme daily rainfall. The annual rainfall data 
    covered the period from 1927 to 2004, while the extreme daily 
    rainfall data spanned 1979 to 2004. The evapotranspiration records 
    are for the period 1979 - 2004. Information on flood occurrence for 
    1994, 2001 and 2004 floods was collected from local newspaper 
    reports, and past history of flood occurrence in the study area 
    were also sourced from the monographs of the Federal Environmental 
    Protection Agency (FEPA). Records of annual rainfall in Makurdi 
    were collected from the publication of Akintola (1986) and the 
    Nigeria Meteorological Agency, Makurdi branch. The extreme daily 
    rainfall and evapotraspiration data were obtained from the archives 
    of Nigerian Meteorological Agency, Makurdi.
In terms of analysis, basic statistical techniques like 
    computation of totals, means and standard deviations were used for 
    preliminary treatment of the data. The annual rainfall trend was 
    determined using spearman rank correlations. In order to determine 
    the significance of the correlation coefficient, it was tested 
    using the Student's T test statistic at 95% confidence 
    level.
The Standardized Rainfall Anomaly Index (SAI) was used in the 
    analysis of annual rainfall variability. The SAI is given as:
Where X is annual rainfall total, X, is the mean of the entire 
    series, and S.D is the standard deviation from the mean of 
    the series.
The extreme daily rainfall characteristics that were analyzed in 
    this study are magnitude - frequency, seasonality and duration. The 
    Gumbel extreme value distribution was used to determine the 
    magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall and hence, the 
    recurrence interval. The method of recurrence interval used in this 
    study is usually employed in the description of probability of 
    recurrence or incidence of extreme events (Dury, 1964; Lang, 1997; 
    Versace and Ferrari, 1997). It is primarily concerned with 
    prediction, such as the estimation of the magnitude of the daily, 
    monthly and annual rainfall total likely to be exceeded on average, 
    say, once during fifty years. Generally, there are two ways by 
    which recurrence interval of rainfall data is carried out, namely: 
    (a) partial series and (b) annual series analyses. The partial 
    series involves the extraction of all values above a given 
    magnitude from the record of daily rainfall over the years of 
    study. The annual series on the other hand involves the selection 
    of the maximum values occurring in each year. The more commonly 
    employed method is the annual series and it was employed in this 
    study to determined various return periods.
The procedures involve arranging the annual series in descending 
    order of magnitude. The recurrence interval (RI) is determined 
    thus:
Where: N = number of events in the series; M = rank of 
    individual event; and RI is return period expressed in years.
The rainfall values were then plotted against their recurrence 
    intervals on Gumbel's probability paper, and a line of 
    "best fit" on the scatter diagram was drawn as described 
    by Dury (1964). The water budget graph was determined by 
    superimposing monthly averages of evapotranspiration on monthly 
    rainfall totals for 1979 - 2004. From this, the duration of 
    flooding in the study area was determined, and this is the period 
    when rainfall is in excess of evapotranspiration.
RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Annual Rainfall Trend in Makurdi; A trend 
    analysis of the annual rainfall of Makurdi for the 77 - years 
    period (1927 - 2004) was carried out by using the Spearman Rank 
    Correlation Coefficient statistics. The annual rainfall trend over 
    the study period was shown to have a negative correlation 
    coefficient of -0.31. The significance of the trend was 
    tested by the student's T-test, and was found to be 
    significant at 95 per cent confidence level. This is an indication 
    that there is a downward trend in annual rainfall in Makurdi town, 
    signifying decline in rainfall.
The rainfall series for the period 1927 - 2004 was further 
    broken into 20- years intervals (i.e 1927 -1946, 1947 - 
    1967, 1968 - 1988) and for a 16 -years period (1989 - 2004) in 
    order to depict short-time trends within the time series (see WHO, 
    1966, and Parthasarathy and Dhar, 1975). The results of the 
    analyses are presented in Table 1.
The results in Table 1 indicate that there is 
    no much variation between the 
    short-term annual rainfall trends and that of the entire time 
    series (1927 -2004). The period 1968 - 1988 indicated an 
    appreciable rainfall decline when compared to the annual trend 
    coefficient of - 0.31. The entire rainfall trend in Makurdi 
    over the study period is shown not to be significant at 95 per cent 
    level of confidence.
Annual Rainfall Fluctuation in Makurdi (1927 
    -2004): An analysis of the annual rainfall fluctuation in 
    Makurdi was achieved by 5 - year running mean (Fig. 1). In 
    terms of actual annual rainfall totals, the wettest years in the 
    period of record were 1933 (1891.9mm), 1963 (1757.4mm), 1947 (1750.4mm), 1955 (1750.1m) and 1999 
    (1617.1mm), and the driest years were, 1988 (841.1mm), 1958 (849.3mm), 1936 (851.1mm), 1973 
    (882.0mm) and 1983 (928.0mm).
When a five - year running mean was put through the annual total 
    rainfall series, fluctuations involving increased annual rainfall 
    totals were most prominent in the periods 1929 - 1932 (1400.0mm), 1945 - 1947 (1350.0mm), 1961 - 1969 (1400.0mm) and 1995 -1999 (1350.0mm). Fluctuations involving 
    decreased rainfall totals were also depicted at the period 1956 
    -1959, with the worst deviation from the mean in the period 1970 - 
    1995 (See Table 2a and b).
Tables 2a and 2b show that the period 1927 - 1970 was 
    characterized by more years of above average rainfall. The period 
    1971-1995 was however characterized by a continuous 24 - years 
    period of below average rainfall, an indication that the climate of 
    Makurdi may be becoming drier recently.
Annual Rainfall Variability in Makurdi: 
    Figure 2 depict that Makurdi has passed through wet and dry 
    sequences over the study period. This station does not exhibit 
    persistence in the pattern of wet and dry conditions. The 
    remarkably below long - term means were recorded in the period 1985 
    - 1996, with 1988 (-1.9) as the year of highest negative 
    deviation. It is apparent from figure 2 that the occurrence of wet 
    years was more than the dry ones from 1927 to 1984. For the past 20 
    years (1985 - 2004), however, only the period 1996 - 1999 was 
    marked by positive departures from the mean. These recent findings 
    contradict the earlier study by Gobo (1988), who argued that for a 
    long - term climatic trend prediction, it is difficult to conclude 
    whether the climate of the study area is becoming progressively 
    drier or wetter.
Magnitude - Frequency of Extreme Daily Rainfall in 
    Makurdi: Table 3 shows the values of extreme daily 
    rainfall and their recurrence interval in Makurdi between 1979 and 
    2004.The characteristic of the increases, the magnitude of rainfall 
    events increase at a lesser rate until a point is reached where 
    lengthening of recurrence interval will involve no increase in 
    magnitude. From Table 2 for instance, it can be inferred that daily 
    rainfall event of 149.3mm, which is the highest in the 
    series, can be expected to occur once in every 27 years. Whereas, 
    daily rainfall amount of 125.3mm, the second in magnitude, 
    can be expected to occur in every 13.5 years. However, for 
    extreme daily rainfall amounts of lesser magnitudes such as 51.3mm and 45.2mm, their recurrence intervals are 1.08 
    and 1.04 years respectively. The expected recurrence 
    intervals of the extreme daily rainfall magnitudes are depicted in 
    figure 3.
Since a high intensity rainfall is that event which exceeds 
    48mm/h (Lang, 1997 and Odekunle, 2001), a look at Table 2 reveals 
    that, in the 26 years series, only one event does not qualify as 
    high intensity rainfall event (45.2mm extreme daily rainfall 
    event of 1988). The year 1988 has also been depicted in Fig. 
    1 as the driest years in the 1927 - 2004 rainfall record of 
    Makurdi.
Seasonally of Extreme Daily Rainfall in 
    Markurdi: Analysis of the seasonality of extreme daily 
    rainfall event shows that the month of August had the highest 
    frequency of 10 events and a total percentage of 36.43 in 
    the series (Table 4 and 5).
Table 5 also reveals that, although the month of June, July and 
    September come next to August with five extreme rainfall events, 
    the total amount of extreme rainfall received in July (428.7mm) falls short of those of June and September, with total 
    rainfall amounts of 466.2mm and 445.1mm received 
    respectively. The least extreme rainfall event in the series is 
    that of October 27, 1988, (45.2mm).
Frequency and Duration of Heavy Rainfall in 
    Makurdi: For the ease of data collection, the frequency 
    of rainfall intensities has been analyzed taking rainfall amounts 
    of <38.1mm for light rainfalls >38.1mm and 
    <50.1mm for moderate rainfall, and >50.1mm for 
    heavy rainfalls (Figures 4,5 and 6).
