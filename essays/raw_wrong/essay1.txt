Education is one of the most important thing that can happen to a person. In Nigeria, many student no go to school because of poverty. Government should please do something! Without education, our future is in danger. I am writing this to beg our leaders to build more schools and reduce money for school fees. My brother James was forced to stop school last year because my father has no money again.
