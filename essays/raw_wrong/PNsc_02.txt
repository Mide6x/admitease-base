Who can develop high blood pressure?
High blood pressure is common. About 25 million Nigerian adults 
    — nearly 1 in 3 — have high blood pressure. It is very common in 
    blacks, who may get it earlier in life and more often than whites. 
    Many Nigerians tend to develop high blood pressure as they get 
    older, but this is not a part of healthy aging. Middle-aged 
    Africans face a 90% chance of developing high blood pressure during 
    their lives. Others at risk for developing high blood pressure are 
    the overweight, those with a family history of high blood pressure, 
    and those with prehypertension (120–139/80–89 mmHg).
High blood pressure occurs more often among blacks than whites. 
    It begins at an earlier age and is usually more severe. Further, 
    blacks have a higher death rate from stroke and kidney disease than 
    whites. The good news is, treatment can control high blood 
    pressure. In addition, lifestyle changes can prevent and control 
    high blood pressure. These include losing weight if overweight 
    (losing 10 lbs can help), increasing physical activity (walking 30 
    minutes per day can help), following a healthy eating plan, that 
    emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods, choosing 
    and preparing foods with less salt and sodium, and if you drink 
    alcoholic beverages, drinking in moderation. If lifestyle changes 
    alone are not effective in keeping your blood pressure controlled, 
    there are many blood pressure medications to help you.
