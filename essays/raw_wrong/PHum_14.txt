Celebrating African Culture
It was a display of Culture and tradition during the recent 
    Udiroko festival celebrated by the people of Ado Ekiti. The yearly 
    cultural feast offers a platform for reunion which the people look 
    forward to with great expectation. Locals and well wishers come 
    from far and near to celebrate a unique age-long festival.
Udiroko Day represents the beginning of a New Year, a time to 
    appraise what they have achieved and what they need to do to move 
    ahead in the New Year.
In accordance with this tradition, this year’s celebration 
    started with “Ijoko Awon Agba” (gathering 
    of elders), an acknowledgment of the unique position of elders in 
    the affairs of the community.
Other activities that herald the final ceremony included Ewi’s 
    Football and Quiz Competition for the youths of the community; 
    Prince and Princess’ Night and Cocktail Party, organised by MTN.
The grand finale, which was held at the palace of the Ewi of 
    Ado-Ekiti, attracted a large turnout. Speaking on MTN’s support for 
    the festival, Olaolu Osundina, Regional Marketing Manager, MTN, 
    South West, emphasised that MTN’s support for the festival is to 
    reinforce the ‘Can do’ spirit of the 
    brand.
“MTN, through its support for the festival, is using the medium 
    to associate and showcase the beauty of the African culture to the 
    world,” he noted. He said the company is using the festival to 
    drive brand affinity, help the people indulge in their passion and 
    empower the host community.
According to him, MTN is passionate about promoting the African 
    culture. “We are rooted in our culture as Nigerians and Africans 
    and MTN is proud to be a facilitator of that celebration,” he 
    said.
