Determination of Lead and Cadmium Contents of Dry Cell 
    Batteries Available in Nigeria
ABSTRACT: Lead and cadmium content of 
    different brands and sizes (N=38) of dry cell batteries 
    (zinc-carbon Leclanche systems) available in Nigeria were 
    determined by atomic absorption spectrometry after acid digestion. 
    The average Pb and Cd content of the dry cells are 1077.9±751.7mg/kg (Range 42-3170mg/kg) and 108.3±81.4mg/kg (Range 4.6-410mg/kg) respectively. The mean Pb and 
    Cd contents of dry cells with metal outer cover were significantly 
    lower (p < 0.005) than the corresponding values for dry 
    cells with non-metallic cover. The highest Pb and Cd values were 
    observed in dry cell batteries imported from China. Higher mean Pb 
    and Cd value were observed in dry cells from China (1368.36 
    vs. 151.47mg/kg), compared to values for dry cells 
    from Indonesia (1032 vs. 84.4mg/kg),Japan (715.2 
    vs. 131.48mg/kg) and Korea (1137.5 vs. 
    81.45). Lower Pb and Cd values were obtained in dry cells 
    from Malaysia (709 vs. 12.5mg/kg), Spain (702 vs. 65.8mg/kg), United States (303 vs. 11.1mg/kg) and in the only surviving local brand (408 vs. 
    34.5mg/kg).Our study revealed that there is an urgent need 
    to introduce an adequate well-established system for collection, 
    separation, storage and management of municipal and industrial 
    wastes containing primary and secondary battery wastes and similar 
    toxic materials to halt the open burning of such wastes within 
    inhabited areas. There is an urgent need to develop in Nigeria an 
    appropriate technology following the principles of waste 
    minimization and sustainable development.
The management of primary and secondary battery wastes is 
    essential in order to avoid or minimize inappropriate disposal 
    which may result in harm to the environment and the human health. 
    Household batteries contribute 52% of Cd and 88% of Hg found in the 
    municipal solid waste, yet they comprise less than 1% by weight of 
    municipal solid waste (Shapek, 1996) 
    .The toxicity and widespread pollution by lead is well 
    known. In fact, lead has been described as the most severe 
    environmental contaminant to arise in human civilization (Smith and 
    Flegal, 1995). Although Pb is ubiquitous in the environment Pb as a 
    pollutant is essentially of anthropogenic origin. The polluting 
    nature of the manufacturing processes of both primary and secondary 
    batteries to the environment (Ward et al., 1977; Semu et 
    al., 1986; Onianwa and Fakayode, 2000) and the adverse 
    health effect on battery industry employees and their families have 
    been established (Bader et al, 1999; Ritcher et al, 1979; Fergusson 
    et al, 1981; Oleru et al, 1983). The absence of environmental 
    protection equipment near battery and waste battery recycling 
    facilities has been associated with increase of Pb in human tissue 
    samples (Wohl et al, 1996; Bader et al, 1999). The manufacture of 
    dry cell batteries expose employees to Pb, Mn, Zn, Cd and suspended 
    carbon black dusts which usually contains polyaromatic hydrocarbons 
    (PAHs). Exposure to carbon black dust in dry cell battery 
    facilities results in significant loss in pulmonary function (Oleru 
    et al, 1983). Higher levels of Pb and Mn have been observed in the 
    body tissues of primary and secondary battery employees and their 
    family members (Bader et al, 1999; Wohl et al, 1996; Lai et al, 
    1997). The high levels of especially Pb observed in the tissue 
    samples of the employees family members reveals a problem arising 
    from employees' transferring lead dust home, probably in their 
    working cloths (Fergusson et al, 1981).
Dry cells are non-rechargeable and of single use. They 
    constitute household hazardous waste when'dead', that is when the components have reached 
    their equilibrium concentrations. The open burning of wastes 
    containing municipal and industrial wastes results in the emission 
    of heavy metals into the atmosphere with fly ash and after fallout, 
    metals in dusts and soils. This form of metal pollution have been 
    classified as an environmental transfer of metal and not a true 
    source of metallic pollutant (Ayres and Ayres, 1994).This is 
    because the metals emitted must have been originally embodied in 
    items of consumption discharged as waste. These toxic metals can be 
    leached from ash and cinder into domestic surface waters by acidic 
    wet precipitation which may result from the large-scale gas flaring 
    by the Nigerian petroleum and natural gas sector. This leaching 
    process can be enhanced by charges in pH, redox potential and the 
    presence of organic chelators. Highly acidic pH of 3.4 has 
    been observed in some natural surface waters in industrial areas of 
    Nigeria (Sridhar and Bammeke, 1986). Such acidic pH can enhance the 
    mobility of metals. The major streams in the industrial cities of 
    Nigeria are already seriously polluted by industrial waste (Ajayi 
    and Osibanjo, 1981) and pesticide residues (Nwankwoala and 
    Osibanjo, 1992). The aim of the present study was to determine the 
    Pb and Cd contents of dry cell batteries available in Nigeria in 
    order to assess the contribution of such consumptions to 
    environmental heavy metals pollution in Nigeria.
MATERIALS AND METHOD
Dry cells of different brands and sizes were purchased from 
    retail outlets in Okigwe, and Umuahia in Southeastern Nigeria. The 
    dry cells were mainly of the Zn/MnO2 system. 
    The brands of dry cells used in this study is shown in Table 1.The 
    dry cells were carefully opened and dried to constant weight for 12 
    hours at 1100C in an oven. The carbon 
    rod and cathode mix (MnO2 + carbon + 
    electrolyte) were ground in a porcelain mortar into a fine particle'black mix'. To obtain a representative 
    sample of the dry cell as is discarded, a weight ratio of 2:3 was 
    used for the metal cover and the black mix respectively. 0.5g of the sample was digested with 2:1 mixture of 
    HNO3/HCIO4. After the 
    initial violent reaction with evolution of brown fumes had subsided 
    (ca. 10min), the digestion flask was covered with a watchglass and 
    digested up to 150°C in a regulated programmable aluminum digestion 
    block. This was then treated with two portions of the 
    HNO3/HCIO4 and 
    evaporated to near dryness. More acid mixture was added and the 
    digestion continued until dense white fumes was evolved, marking 
    the completion of the digestion process. This was then evaporated 
    to near dryness and taken up in 1M HNO3 
    filtered through pre-acid washed Whatman No. 4 filter paper 
    into a 10ml volumetric flask and made up to mark with the 1M 
    HNO3. This was subsequently analyzed for Pb 
    and Cd using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Buck 
    Scientific, Model 210). Internal quality control procedure with 
    re-tests of standards was undertaken. A recovery study of the total 
    analytical procedure was carried out by spiking portions of two 
    previously analyzed brands with varying concentrations of Pb and 
    Cd. These were homogenized, redried and passed through the 
    digestion and analytical steps. Results reported are averages to of 
    duplicates.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Average recoveries of 81 and 91% were obtained for Pb and Cd 
    respectively. These low recoveries may be attributed to the high 
    carbon content of the samples and its high adsorption power. 
    Retention losses are also possible as silica crucibles have been 
    shown to retain an average of 16% Pb (Ajayi et al 2001; Gorsuch, 
    1959). The mean (± SD) Pb and Cd content of the dry cells studied 
    is 1077.9±751.7mg/kg (Range 42 - 3170mg/kg) and 
    108.29±81.41mg/kg (Range 4.6 - 410mg/kg) 
    respectively. Because of the skewed nature of the results obtained, 
    the data was normalized by logarithmic transformation by 
    calculating the geometric mean. A summary of the result obtained 
    according to the sizes of the dry cells is shown in Table 2. The 
    dry cells are grouped according to the type of the outer cover and 
    into'Cd-free cells' and'normal cells' following indications on their labels 
    (Table 3) The mean Pb content of dry 
    cells with non-metal cover (1325.0±857.3mg/kg) is 
    significantly higher (p<0.005 
    )than the corresponding value for the dry cells with metal 
    cover (682.5±307.2mg/kg).Similarly, the mean Cd 
    content of the dry cells with non-metal cover (141.9± 
    82.3mg/kg) is significantly higher (p<0.005) than 
    those of the dry cells with metal cover (54.5±47.9mg/kg),Table 3. This may indicate that dry cells with improved 
    packaging are more environment friendly. In Nigeria dry cells with 
    metal cover are on the average 25% costlier. This improved metal 
    outer packaging reduces leakages even on abusive use of the dry 
    cells.
About a third of the dry cells studied (36%) were imported from 
    China Mainland. The higher mean Pb and Cd contents of these Chinese 
    dry cells compared to cells from other countries ( 
    Tables 4) may be explained by the 
    observation that more than 90% of these cells have non-metal outer 
    cover. The mean Pb and Cd content of the dry cells labeled'Cd-Free' (919.4±660.7mg/kg 
    and 89.6±60.5mg/kg respectively) are lower than the 
    corresponding values for the'normal cells'. This is however not statistically significant. The mean Pb and 
    Cd values of the'Cd-Free' cells with 
    metal cover (724.0±389.9mg/kg and 52.4±63.2mg/kg
respectively) are also lower than the values for the'Cd -free' cells without metal cover (980.7±813.8mg/kg and 133.0±20.0mg/kg respectively). It was 
    observed that three (3)'Cd-free' cells 
    of the same brand (different sizes) have mean Pb and Cd values of 
    743.7mg/kg and 33.7mg/kg respectively. This low mean 
    Cd value appears to indicate a true reduction in the Cd content of 
    this brand. This may indicate the industrial application of the 
    extensive research at reducing/eliminating and finding alternatives 
    to the use of Hg and Cd in dry cells manufacture. The country of 
    origin of this brand of dry cells in however not indicated on the 
    label. A weak, albeit significant, positive correlation was found 
    between the Pb and Cd contents of the dry cells (r = 0.398, 
    p<0.02). This corroborates the result of a study in the 
    vicinity of an automotive battery manufacturing company in Nigeria 
    (Onianwa & Fakayode, 2000). This positive correlation indicates 
    that the estimated regression model of the data obtained, Cd = 
    61.67 + 0.043 (Pb) can explain only about 16% of the 
    variation in the data obtained (R2 = 0.16). This model 
    therefore is insufficient to give accurate predictions. The highest 
    Pb and Cd values (3170mg/kg and 410mg/kg respectively) were 
    obtained in dry cells imported from China (Table 4) The Pb and Cd 
    contents of the only surviving local Nigerian brand are 408mg/kg 
    and 34.5mg/kg. The dry cell from the United States contains 
    303mgPb/kg and 11.1mgCd/kg which are lower than the corresponding 
    values for dry cells from Nigeria, and elsewhere. The Pb and Cd 
    content of the Nigerian brand are also lower than the mean Pb and 
    Cd values for dry cells from China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and 
    Spain (Table 4). About 15 billion batteries are produced in China 
    yearly with about 10 batteries per person per year in China. At 
    present more than 60% of the Nigerian primary battery trade is 
    controlled by China.
In the US, about 2.5 billion household batteries are 
    purchased each year. More than 90% of this is single use batteries 
    that find their way into landfills and incinerators. The US-EPA 
    estimated that in 1989, 88% of the 1.4 million pounds (635 
    metric tonnes) of Hg in urban trash in the US came from single-use 
    batteries (Schwartz et al., 1994).One major concern is that the heavy metals contained by 
    dry cells could leach from landfills into ground water, or shift to 
    fly ash at open waste minimization/burning sites or at 
    waste-to-energy plants (Nakamura, 1996; Malloy, 1994). The 
    management of Ni-Cd rechargeable batteries is a problem that has 
    assumed a global dimension (Rydh and Karlstrom, 2002). In Nigeria, 
    Ni-Cd batteries, auto-rechargeable batteries and primary battery 
    wastes are disposed with municipal waste. Nigeria does not have any 
    integrated framework regarding the monitoring and management of 
    toxic and hazardous materials and wastes. Limited funding has also 
    caused significant impediments to the effective management of toxic 
    and hazardous wastes. Apart from scarcity of financial resources, 
    there has not been any development of appropriate technology 
    following the principles of waste minimization and sustainable 
    development. Any interim effort to halt this form of metal 
    pollution in Nigeria must include the proper financing and 
    management of waste, and the provision of basic infrastructure to 
    halt the open burning of waste in inhabited area. Long term control 
    measures will include legislating and enforcing the removal of dry 
    cells and similar toxic products from wastes to be incinerated and 
    the setting-up of national standards for the levels of heavy metals 
    in dry cells.
