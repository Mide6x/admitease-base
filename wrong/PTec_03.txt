Pragmatic Technologies unveils CyberPower 
    Inverter
Ever wish you could sleep with your fan or AC on, power your 
    computers, keep your food frozen and watch your favourite TV shows, 
    without the usual generator noise? That will probably be possible 
    if NEPA went nuclear. That's not happening soon so, what are 
    your options. Enter the Inverter.
Pragmatic Technologies, a leading technology solutions provider 
    in Nigeria and operator of BuyRight online Gadget store, in 
    partnership with CyberPower Inc, a world leader in inverter 
    solutions, last week unveiled the CyberPower Inverter at a press 
    conference held in Lagos.
The CyberPower Inverter is a consumer oriented power solution 
    aimed at alleviating the power challenges faced by Nigerians in 
    homes and offices across the country. Inverter solutions in various 
    forms have been present in the Nigerian market for some time now. 
    But these, obviously, have not met the needs of the average power 
    consumer.
According to the The MD of Pragmatic technologies, Biodun 
    Marquis, "the CyberPower inverter is maintenance free, 
    provides automatic power switch from the mains to batteries and 
    vice versa, and requires low input DC voltage."
"One of the key things about an inverter is the the 
    type batteries attached to it", he explains further. 
    "Most of our competitors require that you use high 
    input DC voltage, i.e, a minimum of 4 - 8 12volt batteries for a 
    3KVa inverter. The unique feature in the CyberPower inverter is its 
    ability to give you power with just two batteries for the 3 KVa and 
    four batteries for the 5KVa. Some people try to cut corners and by 
    installing inverters with car batteries. Let me just mention here 
    that car batteries are not safe and are, in fact, not designed for 
    use with inverters. We highly recommend deep cycle batteries, which 
    you can optionally purchase from us at BuyRight.
"In the country today, we have people bringing in 
    Inverters and even making them locally. It is important to be aware 
    of inverter capabilities in order to make the right investment. The 
    CyberPower inverter provides the lowest cost-to-benefit ratio not 
    only in the world. You get faster charging â€“ twice as fast as the 
    local competition. You can easily increase capacity by adding 
    batteries sequentially over time, up to desired quantity, based on 
    budget. Our inverter also serves as a stabilizer and a UPS. You 
    don't get that anywhere."
