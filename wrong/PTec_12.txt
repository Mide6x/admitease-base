Qubestreet and Afrovision delivers NaijaBorn
Qubestreet Media and the AfroVisioN Group have partnered to 
    produce NaijaBorn.com, a playground that connects Nigerians 
    & friends all over the world. The site 
    launches this month in its first beta. Through this platform, 
    Nigerians can connect, interact and share their best experiences in 
    Lagos, London, Lisbon or anywhere they should find themselves.
With the vision of Qubestreet Media's Francis Oghuma 
    (NaijaBorn.com CEO and President, product) and 
    AfroVisioN's Mambe Nanje Churchill (NaijaBorn.com CTO 
    and president technology), NaijaBorn.com features a custom 
    built social networking engine that will create a searchable, 
    detailed, user-generated database of the global Nigerian 
    community.
While in beta, NaijaBorn.com features profiles of Active 
    members, a public user-generated blog
    ,status updates features, and a place 
    for users to upload music, 
    artand other media from their experiences. So far, over 
    thousands of members have joined the budding site from places such 
    as new zealand, Japan, 
    poland, 
    oyo,
    ore, 
    ogbomoso, Texas and of course Lagos, Nigeria. Members are 
    established and novice 
    entreprenuers, medical and pre-law school students, 
    software developers and more.
This website will be a valuable way to network for people 
    looking to reach out to the Nigerian audience, as large and diverse 
    as it is. There are plenty of other resources and features coming 
    to the site in the near future. Don't miss out on this
