Living healthily during Ramadan

Ramadan is a month when Muslim faithful fast and learn to exercise self-control. On the other hand, a well-balanced diet is the key to healthy living.

Fasting, in addition to its spiritual significance, is beneficial for one's health. Abstaining from food and water for a period of time can improve physical fitness and mental alertness.

To stay healthy throughout Ramadan, it is important to consume normal quantities of food from major food groups such as bread, cereal, milk and dairy products, fish, meat, poultry, beans, vegetables, and fruits.

Adequate water and juices should be consumed during Iftar (breaking fast) and between Sahur (pre-dawn meal) and Iftar to prevent dehydration. Consumption of large amounts of caffeine-based beverages, especially during Sahur, should be avoided as it can cause insomnia.

Additionally, excessive tea consumption during Sahur can lead to increased urination and the loss of essential mineral salts needed by the body throughout the day. It is recommended to include fruits at the beginning and end of each meal, especially during Sahur.

For individuals who are overweight, Ramadan provides an opportunity to reduce excess weight/fat.
