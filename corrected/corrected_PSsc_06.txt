Maternal Death: Addressing the Crisis Facing Nigerian Women

It took the loss of soldiers in an encounter with Niger Delta militants to prompt military authorities to launch an all-out offensive to apprehend and punish the perpetrators. Why? Because a life dedicated to serving the nation is considered invaluable and worth protecting. However, every day, numerous Nigerian women face the daunting challenge of childbirth, with many not surviving to share their joyous experiences. Shockingly, statistics from reliable sources indicate that maternal mortality in Nigeria is not only alarmingly high but also ranks among the highest globally. What is even more distressing is that despite the government's efforts to address the issue, it has largely been confined to mere rhetoric. This report is compiled by Sola Ogundipe and Chioma Obinna.

A recurring sentiment in Nigeria today is that the easiest way for a woman to face death is through pregnancy. "Approximately every 10 minutes, a Nigerian woman loses her life due to pregnancy-related complications, and hundreds of thousands more suffer injuries from birth-related incidents every year." This grim reality was highlighted as the world observed Safe Motherhood Day on May 26, 2009. Undoubtedly, this paints a bleak picture of the state of affairs in Nigeria.

It is an undeniable fact that women in Nigeria are succumbing to pregnancy-related complications before, during, and after childbirth. The outcry over the avoidable loss of lives has become so commonplace that it echoes like a broken record. Whether it is the sorrow of a woman falling victim to pregnancy-related complications or the tale of another woman surviving but left with lifelong struggles, the underlying narrative remains the same - a nationwide lament over the tragic loss of lives due to maternal mortality.

The high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in Nigeria have persisted, drawing concern and raising alarms. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, a Nigerian woman faces a 1-in-18 risk of maternal death or pregnancy-related causes during her lifetime, surpassing the 1-in-22 risk for women across sub-Saharan Africa. The risk is even higher for women in northern Nigeria, rural areas, and those with limited education and financial resources. This crisis of maternal mortality persists across the country, from Lagos to Maiduguri, Calabar to Sokoto, with no signs of abating.

The statistics are indeed staggering, with a significant number of deaths that are profoundly unsettling. It is estimated that approximately 59,000 Nigerian women lose their lives annually due to pregnancy-related complications, second only to India in global maternal mortality rankings. Nigeria is undeniably grappling with a maternal mortality epidemic, contributing about 10% of the world's total maternal deaths.

This harrowing reality stems from findings indicating that Nigeria has one of the highest maternal mortality rates globally, accounting for roughly 10% of all maternal deaths worldwide. For every woman who perishes, 15 to 20 others endure short or long-term disabilities, such as obstetric fistulae, uterine ruptures, paralysis, and complications like Vesico Vaginal Fistulae (VVF).

Maternal death, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to the "death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination, due to causes related to or aggravated by pregnancy but not incidental or accidental causes." Pregnancy-related death, on the other hand, encompasses the death of a woman during pregnancy or within 42 days of pregnancy termination, regardless of the cause of death.

The majority of these maternal deaths are not only preventable but also needless. A report by the Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) and the Center for Reproductive Rights sheds light on the Nigerian government's accountability for the dire state of maternal health in the country. Titled "Broken Promise: Human Rights, Accountability & Maternal Deaths in Nigeria," the report delves into the key factors contributing to Nigeria's high maternal mortality rate and the associated human rights and legal implications. It highlights governmental failures in leadership, healthcare financing, corruption, limited contraceptive access, and funding as key drivers of the high maternal death rate.

While the Nigerian government has acknowledged maternal mortality as a critical issue and enacted laws and policies in response, the report underscores that these efforts have not translated into substantial improvements in maternal health nationwide. Numerous factors hinder the provision and accessibility of maternal healthcare in Nigeria, including inadequate implementation of laws and policies, systemic corruption, deficient infrastructure, ineffective healthcare services, and limited access to skilled healthcare providers exacerbated by fragmented healthcare responsibilities among the government's three tiers.

The absence of a constitutional or legal framework delineating healthcare responsibilities is identified as the root cause of a dysfunctional healthcare system where all levels of government have failed to prioritize healthcare duties, particularly concerning maternal care. Challenges surrounding resource allocation for healthcare further compound the issue.

The WARDC report emphasizes that "most of these deaths can be prevented. Preventable maternal death and disability are increasingly recognized as pressing human rights issues, involving questions of resource allocation and political commitment for which governments must be held accountable." This underscores the crucial role of government accountability in effectively curbing maternal mortality.

The commitment of the Federal Ministry of Health signals a potential shift in the narrative. Maternal survival took center stage during Nigeria's participation in the 62nd World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, in May 2009. The country engaged in discussions with leading experts in women's healthcare to address the pressing issue. Health Minister Prof. Babatunde Osotimehin outlined various initiatives aimed at improving maternal health, including midwifery schemes, anti-shock garments with blood transfusion services, and enhancing primary healthcare centers with additional resources and improved accessibility.

Furthermore, underscoring the pivotal role of healthcare professionals in ensuring safe motherhood, Osotimehin has advocated for increased skilled birth attendance at delivery points. He emphasizes the need for skilled attendants equipped with necessary skills, supported by conducive healthcare environments at various levels, inclusive of supportive policies, adequate supplies, equipment, infrastructure, efficient communication systems, and referral mechanisms.

While attributing factors such as limited coverage of essential services like efficient family planning, postnatal care, and addressing health challenges such as hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, infections, unsafe abortions, malaria, and anemia, the Minister emphasizes that the high maternal, newborn, and child health indices in the country are unacceptable. He points to the Federal government's implementation of the Integrated Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (IMNCH) Strategy across states as part of ongoing efforts to address these challenges.

According to Dr. Suomi Sakai, UNICEF Representative in Nigeria, "We know how to reduce maternal mortality and illness; it can be done." Basic interventions such as preventing and treating malaria, providing adequate nutrition and antenatal care, training birth attendants, and ensuring healthcare facilities offer emergency obstetrical care are crucial in saving women's lives and safeguarding their children.

With the theme "Skilled Birth Delivery, A Must for Every Mother," there is a rallying call for collective action from all stakeholders to implement a strategic plan aimed at significantly reducing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. While commendable efforts have been made by the government to address maternal mortality, which remains one of the highest globally, the battle is far from over. The narrative surrounding maternal mortality in Nigeria remains contradictory.

It is widely acknowledged that Nigeria possesses the knowledge and means to combat maternal mortality and morbidity through basic interventions like malaria prevention, adequate nutrition, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and access to emergency obstetrical care. Nigeria has the capacity to save the lives of women and their infants, yet it is disheartening to note that more needs to be done to stem the tide of maternal deaths and enhance the well-being of women. Amidst challenges in the healthcare system and service delivery at all levels of governance, there is much room for improvement. If only Nigerian women could stop perishing in the process of giving life.

Linking maternal health with other Millennium Development Goals

The Millennium Development Goal on Maternal Health aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters by 2015. In the developing world, the risk of maternal death due to pregnancy-related complications is significantly higher compared to industrialized nations. Most maternal deaths are preventable, with better healthcare during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period being key interventions.

Effective interventions to improve maternal health include antenatal care, provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care, postpartum care, and family planning in alignment with national policies. These interventions, when integrated across a continuum of care encompassing home, community, outreach, and facility-based services, yield multiple benefits for mothers, children, and communities.

Progress has been made in improving maternal health interventions globally. Antenatal care coverage has increased, with 75% of expectant mothers receiving some form of antenatal care. Many countries have also enhanced skilled delivery attendance. Ensuring the presence of skilled personnel at all deliveries and providing access to emergency care when needed is crucial in saving maternal lives.

However, the pace of progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal on maternal health has been sluggish across the developing world and must be accelerated to meet the 75% reduction in maternal mortality ratio set between 1990 and 2015. Addressing maternal health within a continuum of care that integrates essential maternal, newborn, and child health services is imperative.

Maternal mortality rates often mirror the overall performance of a country's national health system, particularly during delivery and the postnatal period, when mothers and newborns are most vulnerable. Scaling up services that benefit both mother and child is essential, as the health of the mother directly impacts that of her newborn.

"Saving mothers' lives is not only a moral imperative but also a wise investment that benefits their children, families, communities, and nations," stated Tessa Wardlaw
