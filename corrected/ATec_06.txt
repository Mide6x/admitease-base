INTERFERENCE BETWEEN SYSTEMS DUE TO HYDROMETEOR SCATTERING ON 
    SATELLITE DOWNLINK SIGNALS IN TROPICAL REGIONS

INTRODUCTION
The utilization of communication satellites for providing new 
    telecommunication services and enhancing existing ones continues to 
    garner international support and patronage.
Integrated services digital networks (ISDN) connections via 
    satellite for telephony and data communication, internet services 
    relying on very small aperture terminal (VSAT) systems, satellite 
    television, remote sensing of the environment, and others are typical 
    services that rely on satellite communication for dependable and 
    efficient service delivery. In Sub-Saharan Africa, these services 
    are still developing and, if well managed, have the potential to 
    help the region keep pace with the modern information age.
Many communication satellites in use operate at 
    frequencies that are also used for terrestrial telecommunication 
    services such as terrestrial telephony and television broadcast. 
    This situation has created significant pressure on available 
    bandwidth, resulting in bandwidth congestion at lower frequencies. 
    Shifting to higher frequencies equal to or greater than 10 GHz to 
    acquire additional bandwidth has come at a cost to the quality of 
    the desired satellite channel. As the frequency increases, signal 
    degradation due to interaction with hydrometeors also intensifies. 
    Hydrometeor-induced signal attenuation and scattering, signal 
    depolarization, and intersystem interference can become pronounced 
    at frequencies above 10 GHz. For instance, rain scattering is 
    severe at these frequencies due to the raindrop size being 
    comparable to the signal wavelength.
Additionally, atmospheric gases, namely, dry air (oxygen) and water 
    vapor, exhibit significant specific attenuation in the frequency 
    range of 22.2-30 GHz (ITU-R, P. 676-5, 2003).
When the common volume formed by the intersection of terrestrial 
    and satellite signals lies within the bright band (melting 
    layer), reflectivity decreases at a rate of 6.5 dB/km in this region, 
    leading to strong ice scattering and attenuation of the 
    satellite channel. A weak satellite signal at the receiving end 
    is vulnerable to severe interference from a robust terrestrial 
    system operating in its vicinity at the same frequency if 
    their beam centers intersect and contain precipitating particles. 
    Various interference geometries are possible.
This paper focuses on a scenario where a satellite downlink 
    signal is interfered by a signal from a terrestrial microwave 
    network operating at the same frequency as the satellite system. 
    In such cases, there is typically a decline in the 
    signal-to-noise ratio at the satellite terminal due to energy being 
    redirected forward into its receiving 
    antenna system.
Assessing the received interference power is crucial 
    for designing microwave communication systems. Past efforts 
    have been made to quantify interference levels either 
    through direct measurement or simulation. Some of these efforts 
    include Crane (1974), Awaka (1989), Olsen et al. (1993), Holt et al. (1993), 
    and Capsoni and D’Amico (1997). While these endeavors have yielded 
    favorable results in temperate regions, minimal 
    attention has been given to addressing this issue in tropical 
    regions. Ajewole et al. (1999a) and Ajewole (2003) studied the 
    problem using radio-climatological data from Nigeria to predict 
    interference levels on propagation paths in Nigeria.
Despite the extensive research conducted in temperate regions, the 
    findings from such studies are often insufficient for tropical paths. 
    This is because the nature and characteristics of tropical rainfall 
    differ at times from those of temperate regions. Tropical 
    rainfall is frequently convective, characterized by large 
    raindrop sizes, high intensity, and often accompanied by 
    severe lightning and thunderstorms. If a convective rain cell traverses 
    the common volume formed by the intersecting beams of a 
    satellite downlink antenna and a terrestrial microwave relay 
    system, interference will occur in the satellite system as 
    long as the frequencies match. Furthermore, the satellite signal 
    experiences additional rain attenuation (Figure 1) along its path, 
    thus, relying solely on transmission loss statistics will not be 
    sufficient to predict the interference received by the desired 
    satellite channel. This additional attenuation has the potential 
    to further diminish the signal-to-noise ratio at the satellite terminal. 
    Hence, the evaluation of this additional attenuation is crucial 
    in determining the effective transmission loss on the path, and 
    if it exceeds the link margin, it could lead to a complete 
    outage of the satellite channel regardless of the interference levels 
    from the terrestrial system. Therefore, it is imperative to account 
    for this extra attenuation of the desired signal in analyzing 
    intersystem interference for accurate determination of interference 
    levels to aid in better planning and design of 
    microwave communication systems in these regions.

The present study examines hydrometeor scattering in 
    additional locations within the 
    equatorial region of Africa: Douala, Cameroon (9.70°E, 4.05°N), and Nairobi, Kenya (36.75°E, 1.30°S). The study subsequently calculates 
    interference in these locations in terms of effective 
    transmission loss and compares the results with those obtained in Ile-Ife, 
    Nigeria (4.34°E, 7.33°N).

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND INPUT PARAMETERS
The effective transmission loss is defined as the transmission 
    loss minus the additional attenuation experienced by the desired signal 
    (Capsoni and D’Amico, 1997). It is typically evaluated based on a joint 
    and conditioned statistics of the transmission loss and 
    the extra attenuation. It is expressed as:

Where L is the transmission loss defined as the 
    ratio of the interfering transmitted power 
    Pt to the interfering 
    received power Pr at the 
    interfered station, evaluated using the Bistatic Radar 
    Equation (BRE). Aw represents the extra attenuation 
    on the desired signal. Utilizing the simplified form of the BRE (Capsoni 
    et al., 1992), the transmission loss is 
    expressed as:

and the term CV denotes the common volume formed by the 
    interfering beams, evaluated from the following integral:

In equations (2.3) and (2.4) and Figure 
    1, At 
    (R1) and 
    Ar 
    (R2) indicate the attenuations 
    along paths R1 from 
    the transmitter to the common volume, and 
    R2 from the common volume 
    to the satellite receiver. 
    Ag represents the attenuation due 
    to gaseous absorption. Gt 
    and Gr are the 
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains, and λ is the wavelength of 
    the radio signal. The quantities 
    Ft 
    (ύ1, 
    Ǿ1) and 
    Fr 
    (ύ2, 
    Ǿ2) represent the 
    directivity function of the transmitting and receiving antenna 
    systems, calculated in terms of their effective area. 
    σbi is the bistatic 
    scattering cross section defined as the scattering cross 
    section per unit volume of precipitation. It is related to the 
    radar reflectivity factor Z and the point rain 
    rate R as Z = 10log 
    z , where z = 
    aRb . In this study, 
    the tropical lognormal raindrop size distribution proposed by Ajayi and Olsen (1985) was assumed, and as the distribution corresponds well to 
    convective thunderstorm rain types, the Z-R relationship suggested by Ajayi and Owolabi (1987) for tropical thunderstorm rain in the study was 
    used with a = 461 and b = 1.31 
    respectively.

This study encompasses the frequency range of 4–35 GHz currently utilized by 
    most service providers for terrestrial and Earth-space 
    communications. The mean annual cumulative distribution of point 
    rain rate P(R) recorded at the three locations 
    is employed to predict interference levels, with probabilities of 
    occurrence ranging from 1-10-3%.

Signal attenuation due to rain was assessed using 
    the Power law relationship between attenuation and rain rate, while 
    attenuation due to atmospheric gases was computed following the ITU-R 
    Rec. 676-3 (1997). The parameters of the power law 
    relationship for attenuation by thunderstorm rain, applicable to 
    tropical locations and utilized in the study, are detailed in Table 1 
    for vertically polarized signals exclusively.
