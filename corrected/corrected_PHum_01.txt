Tragic Tendencies

Tragedy, in theatre, is akin to what the soul and heart are to the body. Tragedy encompasses the essence of the audience in almost all facets of theatre. Throughout a stage performance, the audience consciously seeks out elements that resonate with them. A significant question arises: how should a playwright portray a hero? What role does a hero, especially a historical figure, play in a narrative that chronicles their adventures?

The treatment of these themes depends on the playwright's approach to the subject matter. In his recent publication, "Discourse on Tragedy," Ahmed Yerima meticulously explores various aspects of tragedy. What defines a tragic play? Why must a character go to extremes, even sacrificing their life, to prove their heroism? Initially, Yerima appears somewhat disjointed in his writing, employing numerous sources and references that do not entirely align with his argument.

However, within theatrical tradition, tragedy holds a central place, serving as the cornerstone of the profession. Yerima dedicates ample time to dissect the essential components of tragedy. He thoroughly examines works not only by Nigerian playwrights like Wole Soyinka, Ola Rotimi, Olu Obafemi, Zulu Sofola, and Femi Osofisan but also by foreign luminaries such as William Shakespeare, Aristotle, and Brecht.

Throughout his discourse, Yerima sheds light on these perspectives, utilizing them to deepen the discussion. He questions whether the elements that define tragedy in Europe or America hold the same significance in Africa. Why do African audiences, instead of mourning, often applaud and appreciate tragic heroes and the symbolism they embody in a play?

Yerima provides insightful answers to these inquiries. He begins his presentation subtly on page 15, deliberately setting the tone to engage the audience in the discourse. Yerima asserts, "I believe that African drama has its roots in traditional storytelling, folk poetry, dances, singing, folk tales, and mythical traditions." These elements form the foundation of the African concept of tragedy, drawing inspiration from tales of heroic figures who have impacted society. The enduring reliance on historical and traditional narratives shapes the portrayal of tragic heroes and heroines.

Yerima refrains from asserting that the criteria for heroism in Europe are identical to those in Africa. Nonetheless, he acknowledges that historical plays often culminate in the demise of the protagonist, whether in Africa or elsewhere.

Quoting Aristotle, Yerima emphasizes that tragedy revolves around a noble individual who, due to their flaws, experiences a dramatic downfall, evoking pity and fear in the audience. Tragedy, as Aristotle posits, is an imitation of events that elicit these emotions. The audience's emotional investment in the tragic hero is evident even before the play unfolds.

Tragedy is an indispensable element in theatrical productions, embodying the essence of the art form. Yerima's book elucidates the crucial factors that compel playwrights to craft remarkable plays. The influence of divine forces on African lives is also a significant aspect explored, alongside the role of folk heroes who guide communities forward.

However, a misstep along the way can lead to a catastrophic conclusion, shifting the audience's perception of tragedy from aversion to admiration, contingent on their inclinations.

On page 61, Yerima discusses why this shift in perception occurs, stating, "In most dramatic tragedies, the protagonist, often a leader, meets his downfall due to conflicts with either gods or men. As a leader, he initiates action, issues commands that may backfire, makes decisions that could be his undoing, and resolves disputes, even if his downfall is the only resolution." 

Moreover, drawing from the insights of psychologists McCrae and Costa, Yerima suggests that a tragic hero typically exhibits neurotic tendencies such as anxiety, anger, and vulnerability. These traits often contribute to the hero's downfall, as exemplified in characters like Kurunmi of Ijaye and Odewale in Ola Rotimi's "The Gods Are Not to Blame."

This book is recommended for those with a genuine interest in studying theatre, catering not only to practitioners but also to individuals involved in writing, teaching, and presenting theatre professionally. It is not a superficial read but rather an academic discourse that illuminates the nuances of tragedy both on and off the stage.
