No serious evaluation of contemporary African history, or sustainable economic development of the region, should ignore the contributions of the creative literature of its people to the African debate. As a Nigerian, it was often frustrating to hear our African neighbors refer to us as Africa's big-for-nothing giant. Even a prominent leader like Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, during his revolutionary years, once labeled Nigeria as an imperialist stooge, though he later apologized for that outburst. However, in this current era, where issues of Sub-Saharan African underdevelopment and Nigeria's role in leading the backward progression are recurring themes in contemporary literary and cultural experiences, one cannot ignore the grim reality of a failing nation. What's even more perplexing is that Nigerian writers and critics have repeatedly warned of the troubles plaguing Nigeria without any genuine remedial actions from our leaders. The consensus that the country is a failed state based on political, educational, and economic assessments is evident, especially considering the cycle of incompetent leadership from figures like Balewa, Ironsi, Gowon, Babangida, Abacha, and Obasanjo.

Amidst this paradoxical situation, Nigerian literature, spanning various genres and forms, has demonstrated a vibrant and intense spirit, with writers like Achebe, Soyinka, Okri, and others making significant contributions both at home and in the Diaspora. This resilience in the face of challenges mirrors the lotus flower thriving in murky waters. Despite the presence of influential figures like Nkrumah, Mandela, and Nyerere guiding the continent's path in the past, Sub-Saharan Africa still struggles with a lack of sustainable economic growth and development, a theme explored in many creative works from the region.

This collection modestly aims to contribute to the discourse on literature and society. While it begins with sharp critiques typical of new Nigerian poetry, subsequent pieces offer more balanced perspectives and reflections. There is a hope for more critical voices in African folklore and a deeper exploration of oral traditions, as seen in the works of Chinweizu and local riddles, to preserve the cultural heritage and prepare communities to face modern challenges. The literary pieces and discussions presented here form integral parts of the larger vision that African writing should continue evaluating its merits and its environment purposefully.

The global readership now recognizes African literature as a means of questioning historical, social, cultural, political, economic, and religious aspects of existence, offering valuable insights to address present political and economic conditions on the continent. While acknowledging the significant contributions of older African writers who fought against colonial oppression, contemporary literati must not emulate the directionless imitation of Europe and America observed in the political, economic, and cultural spheres by modern African leaders, which often draw amusement and contempt from the rest of the world.

By titling the collection "Bards and Tyrants," the author underscores the contrasting directions shaping Africa's fate, as portrayed by visionary literati seeking to elevate educational and cultural potentials against tyrannical figures leading the continent towards degeneracy. It is imperative for all participants in contemporary African writing to address and confront the looming threat of such a devolution in any personal or collective endeavor.
