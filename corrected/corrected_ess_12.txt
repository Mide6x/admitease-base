**1.0 INTRODUCTION**

The wastage of metals due to corrosion has become a significant engineering problem. Aside from a few exceptions, metals are prone to corrosion in regular aqueous environments. Most of these metals have widespread industrial and domestic applications. Probably, no other source of waste, except that affecting human life, is of greater concern to all. According to Speller (1935), it is only through the elimination of waste and the increase in our national efficiency that we can hope to lower the cost of living, on the one hand, and raise our standards of living, on the other. The elimination of waste is a total asset, it has no liabilities. An accurate estimate of the loss resulting from the corrosion of metals is out of the question. However, based on certain available data regarding the average annual renewal of corrugated metals, the cost of replacing corroded parts and preventing corrosion is estimated to be billions of dollars in each of the industrialized countries. The cost of corrosion to the U.S. economy alone is estimated to be $276 billion per year (NACE, 2002). This cost is expected to increase with advancements in technology and the utilization of metals.

The majority of pipeline failures in the petroleum and gas industries are believed to be due to corrosion. For example, Nwilo and Badejo (2001) reported that 50% of the oil spills in Nigeria are a result of corrosion of pipelines and tankers. Additionally, AFX Europe (2004) reported that 1,260 joints in one section alone of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipelines were found to be defective due to corrosion. Our buildings, pipelines, bridges, cars, machines, factories, plumbing materials, engines, and wires are deteriorating on a daily basis because of corrosion. Hence, there is an urgent need for the prevention of corrosion.

Several methods have been devised for reducing or, at best, preventing corrosion. These methods include using the right metal in the proper way and in the correct place, applying protective coatings (such as painting, electroplating, and greasing), using chemical inhibitors and neutralizers, applying protective electrical current (cathodic protection), drying air and other gases to keep humidity below the level where corrosion becomes serious, designing hydraulic systems to avoid excessive velocities or localized turbulence, or to maintain a velocity high enough to prevent the accumulation of corrosion products or other deposits that will promote localized corrosion (Reinhold, 1989). Among these methods, the use of chemical inhibitors and neutralizers remains the most practical and cost-effective means of combating corrosion.

**1.1 Basic Corrosion Concept**

**1.1.1 Definition of Corrosion**

Corrosion is a process that occurs when essential properties within a given material begin to deteriorate after exposure to recurring elements in the environment. This deterioration is often observed in metals and referred to as rust (Davison and Owens, 2003). The National Association of Corrosion Engineers (2002) also defines corrosion as the physicochemical interaction between a metal and its environment, resulting in changes in the properties of the metal, which may impair the function of the metal, the environment, or the technical system of which they are a part.

**1.1.2 Mechanism of Corrosion of Steel**

The corrosion of iron and steel produces the red dust, which is a hydrated form of Fe2O3. The reaction proceeds through a galvanic mechanism in which the electrolyte consists of water containing dissolved impurities. Corrosion begins when regions of iron covered by water become anodic and discharge Fe2+ ions into the water. The electrons travel to other regions on the metal surface, where various cathode reactions occur. In an anodic medium, atmospheric oxygen is quickly reduced to water. A less vigorous reduction occurs at a higher pH. Once the minigalvanic system is established, the two half-reactions promote each other, and the anode region under the water develops into a corroded pit. Rust forms when the Fe2+ ions are oxidized by air to Fe3+ ions.

**1.1.3 Forms of Corrosion**

Fontana (1986) established that the term "form of corrosion" represents corrosion phenomena categorized based on their appearance. Dillon (1982) considered Fontana's basic forms of corrosion and divided them into three groups based on their ease of identification. The three categories are:

**Group 1:** These are readily identifiable by ordinary visual examination. They include uniform corrosion, pitting, crevice corrosion, and galvanic corrosion.

**Group 2:** These may require supplementary means of examination and include erosion corrosion, fretting corrosion, and intergranular corrosion.

**Group 3:** Verification is usually required by microscopy (optical, electron microscopy, etc.) and includes exfoliation, dealloying (selective leaching), stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and corrosion fatigue.

Pitting: This form of corrosion results from local action currents, such as at discontinuities in protective or passive films or under or around deposits that create concentration cells (Reinhold, 1989). Pitting most often occurs with mild steels immersed in water or buried in soil rather than those exposed in the air.

Crevice corrosion: Crevices can be formed by design-detailing, welding, surface debris, etc. Available oxygen in the crevice is quickly consumed by the corrosion process and, due to limited access, cannot be replaced. The entrance to the crevice becomes cathodic, as it can satisfy the oxygen-demanding cathode reaction. The tip of the crevice becomes a localized anode, and high corrosion rates occur at this point (Kalpakjian, 1992).

Galvanic corrosion: One of the best-known forms of localized corrosion is galvanic corrosion, which occurs when two dissimilar metals in contact or otherwise connected electrically are exposed to a corrosive electrolyte (Gibbs, 2002). The part of the metal component that becomes the corroding area is called the anode, while that which acts as the other plate of the battery is called the cathode. The cathode does not corrode but is an essential part of the system. In many cases, the table of equilibrium potentials can be used to predict which metal of the galvanic couple would corrode (Latanision and Searson, 1992). For example, aluminum-graphite composites generally exhibit poor corrosion resistance since graphite has a positive potential and aluminum possesses a highly negative potential. Consequently, the aluminum tends to corrode in the corrosive environment while the graphite remains unaffected. 

Uniform corrosion: Uniform corrosion is characterized by corrosive attack proceeding evenly over the entire surface area or a large fraction of the total area. General thinning occurs until failure. As corrosion occurs uniformly over the entire surface of the metal component, it can be effectively controlled by cathodic protection, use of coatings or paints, or simply by specifying a corrosion allowance (Fontana, 1986).

In other cases, uniform corrosion adds color and appeal to a surface. Two classics in this regard are the patina created by naturally tarnishing copper roofs and the rust hues produced on weathering steels. Metal pickling (scale removal by strong acids) or etching leads to uniform corrosion of metals (Kalpakjian, 1992).

Erosion corrosion: This is the corrosion of a metal caused or accelerated by the relative motion of the environment and the metal surface. It is characterized by surface features with a directional pattern that are a direct result of the flowing media. Erosion corrosion is most prevalent in soft alloys (e.g., copper, aluminum, and lead alloys) (Dillon, 1982). Other factors such as turbulence, cavitation, impingement, or galvanic effects can exacerbate the severity of the attack. Erosion corrosion may be prevented by selecting alloys with greater corrosion resistance or higher strength, redesigning the system to reduce the flow velocity, turbulence, cavitation, or impingement of the environment, reducing the severity of the environment, implementing cathodic protection, and using corrosion-resistant or abrasion-resistant coatings (Dillon, 1982).

Fretting corrosion: According to Dillon (1982), fretting corrosion refers to corrosion damage at the asperities of contact surfaces. This damage is induced under load and in the presence of repeated relative surface motion, as induced, for example, by vibration. Pits or grooves and oxide debris characterize this damage, typically found in machinery, bolted assemblies, and ball or roller bearings. Contact surfaces exposed to vibration during transportation are at risk of fretting corrosion.

Intergranular corrosion: The microstructure of metals and alloys is made up of grains separated by grain boundaries. Intergranular corrosion is a localized attack along the grain boundaries or immediately adjacent to grain boundaries, while the bulk of the grains remain largely unaffected (Dillon, 1982). This form of corrosion is usually associated with chemical segregation effects (impurities tend to be enriched at grain boundaries) or specific phases precipitated on the grain boundaries. Such precipitation can produce zones of reduced corrosion resistance in the immediate vicinity. A classic example is the sensitization of stainless steels. Chromium-rich grain boundary precipitates lead to a local depletion of chromium immediately adjacent to these precipitates, making these areas vulnerable to corrosive attack in certain electrolytes (Dillon, 1982).

Exfoliation: This is a particular form of intergranular corrosion with high-strength aluminum alloys. Alloys that have been extruded or otherwise heavily worked, with a microstructure of elongated, flattened grains, are particularly prone to this damage (Dillon, 1982). Corrosion products building up
