Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)

A 32-year-old woman, Joke Bello, gave birth to the first set of sextuplets in Nigeria in February of this year. She underwent a Caesarean Section (C.S) delivery but encountered complications due to excessive bleeding at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Sagamu, Ogun State, where she delivered the babies. She gave birth on a Thursday and passed away on the following Sunday.

According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) published in 2007, Nigeria has the second-highest maternal mortality rate globally, following India. Each year, over half a million women worldwide die during childbirth, with Nigeria alone accounting for 10% of these deaths.

The escalating rate of maternal mortality in Nigeria is concerning, with the primary cause being excessive bleeding post-delivery, also known as Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH).

Dr. Abdul Lateef A. Imran from Beachland Specialist Hospital in Arepo, Ibafo, Ogun State, highlighted that PPH involves bleeding of 500mls or more following childbirth.

In Derek Llewelyn Jones' Everywoman, it is mentioned that women typically lose between 300 and 800ml of blood after giving birth. This is generally not problematic as the body's blood volume increases by at least one liter during pregnancy. However, serious blood loss can occur in cases of anemia, forceps delivery, Cesarean section, or multiple pregnancies.

David Werner, the author of Where There is No Doctor, explained that while some bleeding is normal after the placenta is expelled, excessive bleeding can occur internally without much external blood loss, leading to abdominal swelling.

Dr. Imran identified anemia as a common factor leading to PPH in tropical regions. He noted that women in these areas often suffer from anemia due to poor nutrition, frequent pregnancies without adequate recovery time, and lack of proper spacing between pregnancies.

He further highlighted that in Nigeria, many women in rural areas lack access to quality healthcare and skilled personnel, leading to delays in receiving necessary treatment for PPH. Financial constraints and bureaucratic procedures in hospitals also contribute to the challenges faced by women in seeking timely medical care.

Dr. Imran emphasized that one of the primary causes of PPH is uterine atony, where the uterus fails to contract effectively after delivery. Conditions such as fibroids or multiple gestations can hinder uterine contractions, leading to excessive bleeding.

Infections and retained products of conception can also trigger PPH by preventing the uterus from contracting adequately. Additionally, scarring in the uterus from previous surgeries or terminations can complicate placental expulsion, resulting in persistent bleeding.

To address PPH, various interventions such as uterine contraction-inducing drugs and manual removal of placental fragments may be necessary. Prompt recognition and management of PPH are vital to prevent fatalities associated with postpartum bleeding.

Dr. Imran stressed the importance of early detection and intervention in managing PPH to improve outcomes for affected women. Recognizing risk factors and signs of PPH can aid healthcare providers in delivering timely and effective care to prevent maternal deaths.

Effective antenatal care, skilled delivery assistance, and prompt referral to appropriate healthcare facilities are crucial in preventing and managing PPH. Ensuring access to quality healthcare services and implementing timely interventions are essential steps in reducing the burden of maternal mortality due to postpartum hemorrhage.
