How to Nurture Customer Relationships During a Meltdown

Step One: Decide that you want to have more fun in your job 

Traditional wisdom states that the purpose of improving customer relationships is to increase sales to those customers. However, while higher sales figures are a natural result of better customer relationships, the true reason for fostering better customer relationships is to make the process of selling more enjoyable and rewarding. Consider this: wouldn't you prefer to spend time with people you like and who reciprocate that feeling, rather than trying to manipulate people into purchasing things they may not want or need? Engaging with people, learning about their lives, is inherently interesting and fun, as long as your intention in building relationships is not self-serving. From this perspective, selling becomes a way to assist the person with whom you have a strong business relationship, rather than an end in itself.

Step Two: Be someone who attracts good customer relationships 

Customers choose to build relationships with sales representatives who embody four key attributes:

1. Professionalism: There is a significant contrast between professionals and amateurs. People prefer engaging with individuals who take their work seriously and are willing to invest time in gaining a deep understanding of their field. Enhancing your level of professionalism can be achieved by reading industry trade journals that enhance your business acumen.

2. Integrity: Integrity means being true to your word. When you commit to something, your customers trust that you will follow through. Integrity is also displayed when you stand firm, even when your stance may not align with your customer or company. It's not about being confrontational but having the courage to make decisions based on what you know is right.

3. Empathy: People value relationships with those who genuinely care about them. Demonstrating care for a customer involves actively listening to what they have to say.

4. Knowledge: People respect those with unique knowledge. This doesn't mean you need to be an expert on every product or service you sell, but possessing valuable knowledge for the customer is essential.

Step Three: Align your thoughts and behaviors to consistently build trust 

Building customer relationships not only depends on who you are but also on your thoughts about yourself, customers, and the sales process. Ideally, all three should be aligned and congruent. Here's how: 

1. Cultivate the right mindset: To have others value a relationship with you, you must genuinely believe that relationship-building is crucial and that you have something valuable to offer.

2. Be curious about people: People are attracted to those who show genuine interest in them. Curiosity about others is vital for relationship-building, offering opportunities to learn and establish connections.

3. Maintain consistency in your actions: A customer's trust in you, and willingness to form a relationship, relies on demonstrating consistent and reliable behavior over time. When a customer can anticipate your actions, they are more likely to trust you.

Step Four: Approach meetings as opportunities to build relationships 

Every customer meeting is a chance to develop or strengthen the relationship, with the messenger (you) being more important than the message (what you say). Rather than a sales pitch, a customer meeting should focus on finding ways for both you and the customer to help each other succeed. To achieve this, follow these touchstones:

1. Seek the truth: Ensure the meeting is aimed at understanding how you can genuinely assist the customer. Customers recognize honesty when you are willing to address potential shortcomings in your product or company.

2. Maintain an open mind: Entering a meeting convinced that the customer needs your product can lead to a closed-minded approach. Being open to the possibility that the customer may be better served elsewhere shows a dedication to their best interests.

3. Foster genuine dialogue: A customer meeting should involve a two-way conversation, not just a sales pitch. Listening to the customer for at least half of the meeting time, engaging in substantive discussions on business matters, not just casual conversation, is key.

Step Five: Maintain and deepen relationships through thoughtful gestures 

Demonstrate care for your customers by noticing their interests and finding small ways to bring them joy. For instance, if your top customer is a football fan, arranging for the local sports section to be sent to them weekly can make a significant impact. Even a simple phone call while you're in the area, even if you can't visit in person, can show your commitment. The emphasis here is on being thoughtful and inexpensive, showing that you care without creating a sense of obligation to purchase.
