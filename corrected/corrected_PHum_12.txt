"The New Gani"

Every person has a story to tell. While some stories conceal filthy secrets, others can be exciting, captivating, educative, chilling, intriguing, and mind-boggling. Stories can be fiction or non-fiction. When stories are non-fiction and involve real characters, many of whom are still alive, as is the case in the book "PRISONER J. 60 – The Legal Struggles of Gani Fawehinmi and What It Means for All of Us," one is tempted to explore the historical accounts of individuals who have not only walked this earth but have also influenced their country as conquerors, carpetbaggers, conquistadors, soldiers of fortune, and civilian primitive capitalists.

Before delving into the review of this book, it is important to note that humans, by nature, can fall into sin at scandalous moments. These scandalous moments can be traced back to the Garden of Eden, where God asked Adam, "where art thou?" Or when God asked Cain, "where is Abel?" after Cain had killed his brother. It's essential to recognize that God had answers to these questions; He was emphasizing the fact that man has failed Him. While we are not here for sermons, as the author of this book delivers on Sundays, I shared with him for the first time since we knew each other professionally that I used to listen to his father's sermons every Sunday when I was a child. This is incidental. The fact is that laws have been passed down from creation through Biblical to modern times. The ability to make mistakes, correct them, and avoid sin is what maintains a cohesive society. A society that disregards history and the rule of law will end up facing threats from rap artists and militants while dancing hip hop.

When society disregards the rule of law, it regresses into the Stone Age and loses its identity with its youth. The rule of the jungle, the dog-eat-dog scenario that the late Ken Saro-Wiwa once described Nigeria as, becomes the norm. In the preface to the book "Scandal," published in 1988 by Christine Keeler, the lady entwined with John Profumo, the British Minister, and Eugene Ivanov, a Russian spy, and M15 (the secret service), she exclaimed, "Here is the truth at last!" One can summarize the book "Prisoner J. 60" as finally revealing the truth. What is J. 60? Let's begin from here. That was the prison number assigned to the legal luminary and radical lawyer honored in this book when he was wrongly imprisoned while seeking justice in the quest to uncover the mystery of who killed Dele Giwa, his client and friend.

This book is dedicated to the late Professor Ayodele Awojobi, who Akinnola describes as "the forgotten Consummate Litigant." Who was Ayodele Awojobi? Awojobi was a Professor of Mechanical Engineering who sued the corrupt and inept regime of Shehu Shagari more than ten times within two years. In the book "Candid Reflections: Reminiscences of a Medical Doctor, Pathologist, Evangelist, and Administrator" by Dr. I.M Malomo, Awojobi was hailed by his peers as a genius.

Like Gani Fawehinmi, Awojobi frequented courtrooms to emphasize his point against corrupt politicians. Some members of the ruling class labeled this kind of behavior as "nuisance value." It was fashionable to hear them remark on 'Gani's nuisance value.' Many geniuses were often perceived as nuisances. There was a time when Wole Soyinka was considered a nuisance. However, when he won the Nobel Prize, those who had criticized him had to retract their words. Those who called Gani a nuisance for suing the government in Nigeria might have wondered why, with his significant hard-earned resources, he did not engage in the exploitation of the country's oil wealth like others. They could have questioned why Gani chose, as Akinnola described it in the first chapter of the book, the path of 'Ganicidal Combative Advocacy.' For a layman like me, I believe there is a correlation between law/order and common sense, and a relationship between logic/reasoning.

Where there is no law, there is no sin, as the saying goes. Where there is no law, there should be common sense. This seems to be the driving force behind the so-called radicals, whether in the legal profession or any other field. Can you narrate the story of Nigeria without mentioning the activities of Gani? Can you recount the story of military regimes in Africa without citing the name of this lawyer who was never a soldier but fought combatively through the use of the law, as detailed in the 234-page book?

Chapter one of the book details the cases based on legal grounds that Gani fought against brutal regimes. It highlights the story of Mr. Minere Amakiri, the Rivers State correspondent of the Observer newspaper owned by the Mid-Western State government. The center of the state where our own Comrade, His Excellency, Adams Oshiomole, currently governs. Mr. Amakiri had reported on teachers' grievances in the Observer on July 30, 1973.

On that day, which coincided with the birthday of Naval Commander Alfred Diette Spiff, now a traditional ruler in the Niger Delta, the governor's ADC, Ralph Iwowari, enraged by the report, ordered the reporter to be given 24 strokes of the cane. Amakiri's head was shaved with an old blade, and he was detained. Gani took up the case and emerged victorious. The details of the case, including conversations between the brutal ADC and Amakiri, are published. The author also sheds light on long-forgotten landmark cases such as the release of Dr. Edwin Madunagu, a mathematics lecturer at the University of Lagos (now on the Board of The Guardian newspapers), and the defense of University of Ibadan students before the Justice Kassim Commission of Inquiry regarding the killing of Adekunle Adepeju. Gani handled several other cases to defend the oppressed, including Alozie Ogugbuaja, the controversial police officer, and rusticated students of the University of Maiduguri. One of these students, who later became a medical doctor, miraculously saved Gani's life when he was detained in Maiduguri. From the first chapter, the author captivates the reader with the story of the lawyer, Gani, who authorities accused in 1978 of "stealing his own camera" and "attempting to burn his own house to embarrass the government." This recollection brings to mind the illogical arguments of successive governments in the country, such as in 1990 when an oil-rich community called Umuechem in Rivers State was accused of "burning down their own houses" as they fled when the police invaded the town and killed their traditional ruler.

Chapter two, titled "Let There Be More Political Parties," delves into the depth of a legal luminary who believes more in the use of law, intellect, common sense, rather than force and brutality in governance. The chapter revisits why Nigeria now has many political parties, as opposed to the three parties it had before 2002. The author reminds us that it was Gani who identified the loopholes in INEC's guidelines that contradicted the constitution. The chapter details a lawsuit filed by 27 litigants led by Gani against INEC and the Attorney General of the Federation, showcasing their organizations, summons, questions, claims, and affidavits. Gani highlighted the contradiction between INEC rules and the constitution and fought for the establishment of more parties up to the Supreme Court level. Lawyers, politicians, and the general public will find this chapter highly enlightening. If not for Gani, some of our present governors may not have held office. The third chapter, "Gani vs. F.R.A. Williams – Between the Activist and the Positivist Legal Prism," revisits the importance of ensuring just laws and their fair administration.

Lord Denning's remark is recalled, emphasizing the dual aims of ensuring just laws and just administration. The chapter questions how many legal practitioners or judges in our country uphold this rule. Were the oppressive laws under the military solely drafted by soldiers? Or were they also drafted by journalists or laymen like me? The author recounts a story where a lawyer named Hogan expressed a preference for wealthy clients in significant trouble. F.R.A. Williams, on the other hand, was inclined towards taking high-profile cases, even if it went against public interest and social justice. The differences in approach between Gani and F.R.A. Williams are highlighted, with Gani focusing on social justice, particularly for the oppressed. The professional animosity between these two legal giants is chronicled, with Gani often criticizing Williams for citing cases from around the globe instead of utilizing local cases. This professional clash mirrors the sentiments expressed by Fela Anikulapo concerning the judiciary's actions back in the day.

Apart from showcasing the drama between Gani and F.R.A. Williams, the author also delves into archives to explore why The Guardian newspaper shifted from its "Simply Mr." policy used for addressing individuals at its inception. The climax of the clash between Gani and F.R.A. Williams is detailed, highlighting how Gani unearthed an old case where a judge in 1949 mentioned that F.R.A. Williams had no regulation to protect. Gani confronted F.R.A. over a case involving Newswatch and alleged libel on the "Simply Mr." story. Chapter four of the book focuses
