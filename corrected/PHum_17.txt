Inside the world of men

"It's a man's world" is a familiar expression. This argument was brought to the stage in the satirical Tarzan Monologues that premiered at Terrakulture last weekend, as reported by Joe Agbro Jr.

The stage was set for a masculine show - five male mannequins, dressed in various attires, hinted at male ego. One mannequin, dressed as a hip young man, wore a hooded top over a Nigeria-branded T-shirt and held a microphone. Another was casually seated in jeans, a T-shirt, and leather slippers. One was geared up as a motorbiker, and another was clad in a green caftan made from local fabric with one hand in handcuffs. Also present were a chair and a drum. This was the setting at the world premiere of Tarzan Monologues, written and produced by Wole Oguntokun. The performance took place at Terrakulture, an elegant arts caf√© in Victoria Island, Lagos.

In 27 short takes, the monologues delved into the world of men from their perspective. Each of the seven actors took turns explaining issues such as money, sex, women, sexual abuse, pressure, sterility, virginity, job loss, age, marriage, and infidelity from a man's viewpoint. As each actor spoke, the others posed, sitting, standing, and blending with the mannequins on stage. At times, it seemed as if the mannequins might come to life with their own stories of being misunderstood.

Starting with fair-skinned Kanayo Okani in "E get as e be," he emphasized the importance of money and later discussed the allure of going to America. Paul Alumona caused a stir as he recounted how his aunt introduced him to the world of sex at a young age. Jack Gowon's mother, portrayed by Kunle Adeyoola, highlighted the expectations some mothers place on their children. Precious Anyanwu shared the story of Hadijat, a girl he used to play with who now pretends not to know him. The monologues also touched on women's perceived greed and the frustrations of unemployment.

Interwoven with the monologues were chants, murmurs, songs, and dancing to popular tunes like "Tima na money" by Ray Mike Nwachukwu, "Suddenly" by D'Banj, and "Face me I face you" by Sunny Neji. Drummer Taiwo 'Keleko' Adesoji kept the tempo high with his drumming.

O.C. Ukeje, the AMBO winner, addressed issues like erectile dysfunction and the dynamics of relationships behind closed doors with humor and poetry. Bimbo Manuel, a veteran actor, stood out with his commanding presence on stage, discussing older men befriending younger women.

The monologues concluded with the presentation of the "six myths of marriage." Kenneth Uphopho, a dancer, listed each myth, with the final one suggesting that a man would learn to stand up to his mother after marriage, eliciting laughter from the audience and cast members.

Tarzan Monologues can be seen as a response to Vagina Monologues, shedding light on how men perceive the world.
