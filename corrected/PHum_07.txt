A Wonderful Linkage

The book, written and edited by Bukonla Akinwade, precisely delivers what it promises in its title: it provides insight into the path a man should take as he grows, offers answers to achieving an excellent life, and advises on confidence building and good character as essential components of a successful life.

What sets this account apart is the diligent approach the author takes in using various subjects as a platform to discuss her recommended traits for a successful life. The author skillfully weaves everyday stories from the streets of Nigerian communities into the narrative, emphasizing confidence building as a key element.

The seamless integration of social and spiritual aspects, along with biblical references, without losing focus on the intended message, distinguishes "Young and Confident" as a standout book.

With a foreword by Professor Michael Omolewa, Nigeriaâ€™s Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to UNESCO, the book's eleven chapters focus on cultivating a great and progressive society by imparting readers with the qualities needed for a first-rate personality.

The book is a compilation of materials from the author's column in Redemption Light, the official magazine of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, recognized as one of the fastest-growing Pentecostal churches globally.

In his foreword, Professor Omolewa observes that the book's tone is primarily focused on confidence building. In Chapter 2, the author explores the positive relationship between Paul and Timothy to illustrate qualities that should define a relationship: a shared aspiration for greatness and companionship that is altruistic, optimistic, and forward-thinking.

In Chapter 3, the author expresses unease about her creative abilities while introducing the book's purpose through the lyrics of Christy Lane's song, "One Day at a Time." Drawing inspiration from Dr. Myles Munroe's speeches, the author recounts the story of a young banker who tragically took his own life, highlighting the importance of fulfilling one's potential before it's too late.

The author elaborates on the concept of "dying empty," emphasizing living a selfless life and giving one's all without reservation, so that nothing is left undone when the time comes to depart from this world.

While the author briefly touches on individuals who died empty, it would have been beneficial to provide examples of those whose legacies continue to impact lives today. Exploring their contributions to individuals, communities, and nations would have further inspired readers in their pursuit of an excellent life.

The author's use of allegory throughout the storytelling captivates readers and makes the book compelling even for those who may not typically engage with such content.

Although the book is tailored for young readers, individuals from all backgrounds will find inspiration regardless of age, race, or creed. Mentors and leaders can also benefit from the book as a resource for their daily interactions. The publication of this collection is a commendable initiative and contributes meaningfully to nation-building efforts.
