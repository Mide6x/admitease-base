Makeup Tips for Older Women

Makeup for older women should serve two purposes. First, it should add color to faded skin. Second, it should conceal minor flaws and wrinkles as much as possible. It is important to understand that makeup for older women is not meant to heavily layer the face with foundations and colors in an attempt to make them look younger. Instead, it is intended to enhance the natural mature beauty that can make a woman appear younger as a by-product rather than a goal. Women with mature skin are as beautiful as youthful individuals, just in a different way. Below are some compiled tips for makeup for older women.

To begin, the foundation for mature skin should be of medium weight. Mature skin with wrinkles can appear deeper with heavy foundation. For mature skin, it is advisable to opt for lighter or sheer foundations. A sheer or medium-weight foundation will reflect light and conceal blemishes. An oil-based foundation should be applied over a daytime moisturizer designed for mature skin.

A general rule when applying makeup for older women is to avoid using too much. Heavy makeup that does not blend well with your skin tone or accentuate your best features can actually make you appear older. It is essential that your eye shadow and brow colors complement your skin tone. Cream-based eye shadows are recommended as they moisturize while concealing flaws. Dark under-eye circles can be minimized by using a concealer that is one shade lighter than your foundation.

Another tip for applying makeup for older women is to use a small amount of blush on the cheeks to achieve a glowing effect rather than a heavy, unnatural appearance. Additionally, lipstick for older women should contain moisturizing properties as their lips tend to dry out and require frequent hydration.

By carefully selecting and applying makeup for older women, the beauty of mature individuals can be enhanced. Subtle application and colors that accentuate natural beauty while minimizing signs of aging can help to diminish the appearance of age.
