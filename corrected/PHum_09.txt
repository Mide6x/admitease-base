Seeking Support for Mission Work

In the 18th and 19th centuries, missionary work was characterized by a comfortable life in Western countries such as England and other parts of Europe. Answering the call was once considered a revered service until missionaries were required to serve in the jungles of Africa, where many lost their lives to various diseases or hostilities from villagers. Despite the challenges, missionary work was still desirable.

Today, the landscape has shifted. Becoming a missionary now comes with risks as support from missionary societies like Christ Missionary Society (CMS), Baptist, and Methodist organizations is no longer sufficient to sustain the numerous missionaries across the continent. The early missionaries deserve credit for leading a majority of Africans to embrace Christianity, steering them away from their primitive lifestyles.

"Sadly, missionary work is becoming a solitary existence," remarked Reverend David Hinderer, the first missionary to visit Ibadan.

On one hand, the British government was more interested in Nigeria's palm produce and natural resources than in spreading the gospel. Consequently, the funds that were once consistent are no longer forthcoming.

In the 21st century, the situation has not improved. Missionaries across the country face hardship, with many forgotten in remote villages, living with strangers, and spreading the gospel. "Our only joy is witnessing people give their lives to Christ," shared an anonymous missionary.

When the challenges became overwhelming for Pastor Samuel Adebayo, he resorted to selling firewood and taking on menial jobs to support himself and his family in the absence of expected assistance.

"The traditional chief, Baale, of the mission field where I am stationed was always against me because we did not contribute money for their sacrifices. They attempted to harm us; however, their efforts failed, and someone was falsely accused of murder behind my house. Thankfully, I was eventually acquitted," Pastor Adebayo recounted.

For Pastor Edward Dooga, a liaison officer representing Nigeria Evangelical Missions (NEMA) in Lagos State, marriage poses a significant challenge for missionaries with families. "It was challenging for a young man dedicated to missionary responsibilities to find a wife, as many eligible women doubted my ability to provide, and I was unwilling to leave the mission field for anything," he shared.

Despite the obstacles, Dooga emphasized that mission work is essential and non-negotiable for Christians, representing the church's core purpose on earth.

Pastor Sunday Bakare, serving in Ogunronbi, Ogun State, shared his harrowing experiences as a missionary from a Muslim background. He highlighted the disparity between urban and rural support for missionaries and the struggles they face in remote areas.

Despite the hardships, support is starting to trickle in for missionaries, albeit insufficient considering their numbers and the scale of their work. Organizations like Journalists for Christ (JFC) and Mission House International are stepping up to visit missionaries in remote areas, providing much-needed support to aid their mission work.
