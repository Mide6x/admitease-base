Facebook: Perfect Time Waster or Perfect Social Networking Site

An Arab Proverb suggests that to grab the attention of others, it is often wise to have a different opinion. Though this may bring controversy, it often gets you noticed. This is what Facebook has achieved over the years.

So, what is Facebook? How did it come about? Why is it so hugely popular? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using it? This essay will address these questions and seek to explore why Facebook has become the trend in the world today.

Facebook is simply a social networking website owned and operated by Facebook, Inc., a company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It is free, accessible worldwide, and its users (currently over 200 million) join the network by signing up at the website www.facebook.com.

According to Compete.com, Facebook is the most used social network by global monthly active users. It was founded on February 4th, 2004, by Harvard University computer scientists Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. The website's name is believed to be derived from a book given to incoming students at Phillips Exeter Academy - the high school alma mater of Mark Zuckerberg. Initially restricted to Harvard students, membership later expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. Presently, the website boasts over 200 million active users worldwide.

Why is Facebook immensely popular? There are several reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, it is free and features an easy-to-use interface that even the least internet-savvy individual can navigate. Its numerous features, attributes, and customization set it apart from pre-existing social networking sites. For instance, users can join networks organized by city, workplace, school, or region to connect and interact with friends and other individuals. Users can add friends, send and receive messages, upload and share pictures, videos, websites, links, and update their personal profiles to inform friends about themselves. Notably, Facebook's high level of customization, unlike other social networking sites, is a distinguishing factor. While Facebook allows plain text interaction, navigation, and personal profile customization, other sites like MySpace only permit the use of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), requiring some programming knowledge.

Other features on Facebook include Wall (enabling friends to post messages for each other), News Feed, Pokes, Notes, videos, and Photos, to name a few. Through these features, users communicate and share online content worldwide in a manner unprecedented on the internet. Facebook has become a crucial medium for organizing parties, events, meetings, and appointments. For instance, the recent demonstrations and protests against election results in Iran across Europe were coordinated using Facebook's events feature. These instances have contributed to the website's increased popularity and versatility.

Turning to the drawbacks of Facebook, it is crucial to consider its merits first. Despite differing opinions, Facebook, like any human creation, has its pros and cons. The versatility of Facebook is evident in reuniting long-lost friends and acquaintances. Millions of messages, photos, profiles, and details are exchanged daily among friends, fostering interactions, idea sharing, and the opportunity to meet new people. The site helps build and strengthen social connections across diverse cultures and ethnicities, promoting global integration and healthy relationships. This achievement is remarkable given Facebook's relatively short five-year existence. Personally, I have reconnected with many old classmates living miles away, offering a wonderful experience.

However, every coin has two sides. It is a common fact that all human inventions carry disadvantages due to inherent weaknesses exploited by ill-intentioned individuals. One of Facebook's demerits is its potential for consuming excessive time. Many users become addicted, spending hours chatting and interacting, hindering productivity. Some even misuse work hours to browse Facebook updates and statuses, prompting some organizations to ban its use on their networks due to reduced productivity. Like most online platforms, Facebook is susceptible to cybercrime.

Recently, users have reported receiving spam emails disguised as messages from friends, raising concerns about data safety, identity theft risks, and cybercrime. While the owners assure Facebook's safety amidst increasing cyber threats, users should exercise caution when sharing personal information and accepting unknown friend requests. The ease of adding unknown individuals to one's friend list on Facebook poses risks, potentially facilitating fraud attempts or cybercrimes.

Reports have surfaced of users attempting to defraud others via Facebook. For instance, a European newspaper highlighted an incident involving the daughters of a US President being targeted in a cybercrime scheme through Facebook. While this cannot be definitively confirmed, it underscores the importance of safeguarding personal information online, especially on social networking sites. Such issues have sparked controversies globally, leading to intermittent bans on Facebook in countries like Syria and Iran, particularly due to its perceived role in political dissent, especially among the youth.

In conclusion, Facebook, like many internet social platforms, presents both advantages and disadvantages. As outlined in this essay, the benefits are plentiful, but so are the drawbacks. Termed the "perfect time waster" by some employees, Facebook's ban in many workplaces emphasizes the need for addressing pertinent issues like privacy breaches, lawsuits, and litigations. Despite these challenges, Facebook remains a valuable addition to online social networking, shaping the future of internet socialization. In my view, Facebook is an exceptional networking tool, offering a perfect way to utilize free time when feasible. In the final analysis, Facebook represents networking excellence and embodies the future of online socializing - it is the "Face of a Sociocyberbook."
