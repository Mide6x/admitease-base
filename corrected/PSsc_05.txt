Caring for Children with Autism

The majority of children with behavioral, attention, language, communication, and learning disabilities such as autism are not identified early enough. However, an organization has decided to bring smiles to the faces of parents caring for such children, as reported by Funmi Ogundare.

Master Chidiebere Nwankwo (a pseudonym), the second of five siblings, was born appearing as a typical child. But at the age when he should have been reaching developmental milestones like his peers, he began to exhibit unusual behaviors such as difficulty with sleeping, eating, and toileting, not responding to his name when called, showing abnormal reactions to pain or pleasure, being deaf to loud sounds but sensitive to quiet noises, among other symptoms.

His concerned parents took him to a pediatrician for a medical evaluation. They were then advised to consult a neurosurgeon, who diagnosed him with autism.

Researchers suggest that the disorder is linked to heightened nerve excitability and predominantly affects males. In light of this, the Zammarr Institute, a non-governmental organization supporting children with developmental and learning disabilities, recently held a one-day training workshop titled "Understanding Children on the Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Implications for Families and Teachers." The workshop was designed for parents, teachers, and social workers.

The institute's founder, Mrs. Ronke Katagum, highlighted the importance of raising awareness about the disorder, noting its rapid growth and lack of a known cure. She emphasized that behavioral interventions and biomedical approaches could significantly alleviate the challenges associated with autism.

When asked about her motivation to work with autistic children, Katagum shared, "It has always been my aspiration to support children with mental challenges. These children are often overlooked, and their needs are not adequately addressed. I began my journey in 1997 by studying autism-related courses, and today, I am better equipped to make a difference."

Katagum urged stakeholders to prioritize autism, emphasizing that the disorder can affect anyone and that early intervention is crucial for better outcomes, regardless of the child's potential.

According to Mrs. Eileen Hopkins, the International Development Director of Autism Speaks United Kingdom, autism is a spectrum of developmental disorders characterized by impairments in language, social behavior, and certain physical behaviors, with symptoms varying in severity. Biomedical factors such as allergies, vaccines, genetic predispositions, and neurodevelopmental influences have been associated with the disorder.

Hopkins explained that parents of children with autism may initially have concerns about their child's development but should come to terms with the diagnosis promptly. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) typically struggle with social communication, interaction, and imagination. She highlighted the challenges these individuals face in understanding social cues, processing language, interpreting body language, and engaging in effective communication.

Teachers, Hopkins suggested, should be informed about a child's condition to provide appropriate support in social interactions and communication. She emphasized the importance of developing Individual Education Plans (IEPs) and potentially involving Learning Support Assistants (LSAs) to aid children with autism in academic settings.

Moreover, Hopkins stressed the need for educators to ensure that children with autism are not disadvantaged or treated unfairly due to their condition. She underscored the importance of expanding treatment options, including biomedical and technological interventions, to better support children with autism.

A parent, Mrs. Aishatu Tukur, acknowledged the financial challenges of caring for a child with autism, emphasizing the necessity of ongoing communication with healthcare providers and conducting research to provide optimal care. She highlighted the importance of integrating autistic children into mainstream schools with proper communication and collaboration between parents and educators.

Another parent, who preferred to remain anonymous, shared the difficulties of raising a child with autism and the financial commitments involved in providing specialized care. Attending workshops like the one organized by the Zammarr Institute was described as enlightening and empowering, offering valuable insights on effective ways to support their child. The parent emphasized the crucial role of parental involvement and attention in ensuring the well-being of children with autism.
