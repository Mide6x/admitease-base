How advanced is Samsung's PIXON-12?
Throughout this year, we have seen a surge of impressive phones entering the market, particularly in terms of camera pixel strength, document viewing capabilities, Wi-Fi connectivity, GPS, and more.
Samsung has once again pushed boundaries by introducing a 12.0-megapixel camera - not as a standalone digital camera, but integrated into a mobile phone! Just imagine the possibilities with such a high-resolution camera. This device is known as the PIXON-12, or M8910. Resembling the Omnia and the 5800, but closer to the 5800 in design, the PIXON features an AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display with 16 million colors, sized at 480 x 800 pixels and 3.1 inches.
It has been mentioned that the PIXON may include an accelerometer sensor, which is crucial for utilizing the 12MP camera effectively for viewing purposes. The official announcement stated a release date before the end of the month.
Despite its impressive camera capabilities, the PIXON has relatively low internal memory at 150MB. However, it does support external memory cards up to 16GB. The PIXON operates on Class 10 for both GPRS and EDGE but does not support HSCSD. It connects via WLAN only, raising questions about the absence of built-in Wi-Fi technology and processor.
The camera is undoubtedly the highlight of the phone, featuring auto-focus, xenon flash, power LED flash, touch auto-focus tracking, geo-tagging, face/smile/blink detection, wide dynamic range, and smart auto mode.
Samsung seems to be aiming to compete with Nokia's dominance in the market, and with the PIXON-12, they are making a strong statement.
