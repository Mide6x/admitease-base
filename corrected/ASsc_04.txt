Furthermore, the United Nations suffers from fundamental structural flaws in its ability to effectively respond to conflicts.

The proposed conflict management system is centered on utilizing problem-solving techniques to comprehensively address adversarial relationships globally at three levels: conflict prevention and peace promotion, conflict control and abatement, and conflict resolution. The concept behind this three-tier conflict management system is to ensure that conflict management efforts consciously work towards eliminating conditions that foster conflict and discord within the global system. It aims to ensure that if conflicts still arise despite these efforts, they are managed productively to prevent escalation into open violence or to minimize the level of violence, which could potentially lead to terrorism and war.

At the conflict prevention level, establishing sound behavioral guidelines, promoting democracy, implementing confidence-building measures, and fostering inter-state or inter-group cooperation and integration are essential actions to reduce conflict incidents. To make a significant impact in this area, the UN should initiate the development of a new world order collectively designed to be integrated into a behavioral code for its members. This could start with a regional-level process before culminating in a global conference with delegates from all regions of the world, including religious and civil society groups, ensuring gender balance.

Additionally, creating a global coalition against the hasty resort to armed hostilities is crucial. This coalition should focus on advocating for demilitarizing the international system and reallocating world resources from military purposes to eradicating human suffering. Involving religious and civil society groups to promote the campaign's objectives could garner global support, reducing the frustration that leads to terrorism and providing a moral foundation for addressing terrorism effectively.

Peacekeeping and other peace support activities fall under conflict control and abatement. While the UN has been relatively active in these areas, enhancing resources for UN peacekeeping and peace support operations is necessary to facilitate timely interventions with enforcement capabilities when required. Efforts should also concentrate on reducing the number of conflicts reaching this level by taking effective actions at the conflict prevention and peace promotion stage.

Lastly, at the conflict resolution level, where core conflict issues are addressed, the UN must enhance its capacity to facilitate intensive negotiations between conflicting parties. Building a corps of mediators to form a UN negotiation team for mediating conflicts is vital to eliminate violence from adversarial relationships. Adequate resources should support the team to intervene promptly and bring conflicting parties to the negotiation table early to prevent conflict escalation.

The integrated conflict management model proposed holds significant importance for Africa due to the prevailing conditions on the continent. It provides a more reliable approach to combat terrorism in Africa, considering the continent's vulnerability to terrorist threats amid poverty, resource mismanagement, and governance challenges. African countries, despite being rich in resources, lack the technological and industrial capacity to combat terrorism solely through militaristic means. Relying on external sources for military equipment would exacerbate their dependency and compromise strategic control.

Unlike the potential negative impacts on African states, the militaristic response to terrorism benefits industrial nations with robust military industrial complexes. Therefore, it is in Africa's best interest to distance itself from the indefinite war on terror and adopt the integrated conflict management approach to eradicate terrorism effectively.
