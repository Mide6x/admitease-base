The prevailing perspective on language status has been long-standing. Critics like Wittgenstein have not been dominant. Recently, scholars such as Dretske, Fodor, Pinker, and others have focused on a semantics for "mentalese" alongside followers of Grice, who emphasize the role of speaker intent in determining the meaning of natural language. All agree that the primary carriers and determinants of semantic properties are different from natural language.

There is an alternative view that natural language has meaning beyond being merely a derivative encoding of thoughts and the primary bearer of meaning. Since the fundamental purpose of language is to convey information about how things are perceived in the world, in line with Locke's caution against taking words as representing reality, which distorts their usage and introduces inevitable obscurity and confusion into their meaning whenever they are made to represent anything other than the ideas in our minds.

The analysis of how the meaning of natural language can be understood as a special case of natural meaning is complex due to the presence of intelligent language users. It can be argued that linguistic meaning closely resembles natural meaning given the involvement of an intelligent agent in linking the world and linguistic representation causally.

Physical systems designed to convey information, such as non-intelligent instruments, have display states that signify different meanings. By establishing a case for a meaning for linguistic displays related to natural meaning, three ways are presented in which natural language meaning could be seen as derivative of natural meaning. It is essential to revisit Paul Grice's seminal paper "Meaning" to evaluate if the distinction between natural meaning and linguistic meaning is as significant as Grice suggests.

Since the publication of Grice's "Meaning," attention has mainly focused on his theory of non-natural meaning. Concurrently, others have been exploring various forms of natural meaning, notably Fred Dretske and Jerry Fodor, who seek to understand the meaning of mental representations through the information they convey. While many have rejected Grice's highly intellectualized theory of meaning, there has been limited discussion on Grice's original distinction between the two types of meaning, which remains intriguing and warrants revisiting in light of subsequent developments.

Grice initially differentiates between two types of meaning and subsequently delves into what he terms as non-natural meaning. He provides examples and draws conclusions about the differences between natural and non-natural meaning. Grice's examples illustrate that non-natural meaning allows for statements like "x means that p, but in fact not p." However, there are instances where natural meaning does not exhibit a consistent link between a sign type and an indicated state of affairs, challenging the distinction between natural and non-natural meaning.

Grice's distinction between natural and non-natural meaning raises queries about the attribution of intent to inanimate objects like bells and remarks. It is essential to consider the implications of attributing meaning to non-agents in cases where the agent is unknown. Grice's theory encounters challenges when suggesting what a conductor should have intended by the rings of a bell, as it contradicts the concept that "A meant something by x" equates to an intention to produce an effect in the audience.
