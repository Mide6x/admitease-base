Once the government has made a decision on privatization, a surge of advertising typically ensues with catchy language displayed in both print and electronic media to showcase the benefits of deregulating the downstream oil sector. Claims of enhanced social services like healthcare and education at all levels, road construction and repairs, among others, are made. However, when there is a stark contrast between the promises of social amenities and the harsh realities of Nigerian social conditions, it prompts questions about the effectiveness of elaborate advertising campaigns.

According to some social scientists, there appears to be collusion between independent marketers and the ruling class driven by profit motives. The pursuit of maximizing profits seems to be their primary satisfaction, forming a network of profit-driven individuals who control pricing mechanisms to maintain high prices in their respective sectors. This behavior mirrors the practices of vehicle spare parts dealers in various parts of the country, highlighting an undesirable side of capitalism.

The consequences of this profit-driven system on the economy are significant. Increases in fuel prices have widespread effects on transportation costs, prices of goods and services, factory operations, and overall production costs, leading to a substantial rise in inflation. This reality is often overlooked or downplayed by proponents of deregulation, emphasizing the positive aspects while neglecting the negative impacts on the economy and society.

The reduction of subsidies in key sectors such as education and health presents a contradiction to the purported benefits of removing subsidies on petroleum products. The removal of subsidies results in inflation, leading to further removal of subsidies in other sectors like education and health. Privatization of universities, hostels, lecturers' quarters, teaching hospitals, and general hospitals follows suit, potentially leaving ordinary Nigerians vulnerable to further privatization. This disconnect between language and reality can lead to miscommunication and social unrest, underscoring the importance of maintaining transparency and truth in governmental policies.

The discourse on language in relation to economic reforms and national development reveals a critical aspect often overlooked in Nigeria. While economic reforms aim to transform the country into an 'African Tiger,' they often neglect the essential components of human development such as language, culture, and mental well-being. National development encompasses various dimensions beyond economic progress, including political, legal, socio-cultural, administrative, and linguistic changes, where language plays a fundamental role.

Language is a vital factor in national development, influencing communication, expression, and understanding of development programs and strategies. Neglecting the role of language can result in poorly articulated and misunderstood initiatives. Language serves as a common denominator in human activities, shaping thoughts, expressions, and societal interactions crucial for national development. Acknowledging the significance of language can enhance the effectiveness and inclusivity of development programs, ensuring all segments of society actively participate in the development process.
