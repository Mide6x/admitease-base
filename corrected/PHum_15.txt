Adeyemi’s Art Odyssey
He aspired to become a medical doctor, a profession treasured by his father who hoped he would pursue it. However, fate had other plans for him, and today, he is content with embracing a career that ignites his passion. Meet Kunle Adeyemi, an art scholar and an authority in printmaking and painting. Adeyemi’s profound love for the arts is evident, leading to his widespread recognition for his significant contributions to the industry. After 25 years of professional practice, this esteemed artist shows no signs of slowing down but instead aims to further propel the industry forward.

Turning fifty is often seen as a significant milestone warranting celebration. Adeyemi, however, opted for a distinctive form of celebration by hosting an exhibition to showcase his creative works accumulated over the years.

For him, marking his birthday with an exhibition is not only a milestone but also a moment of gratitude towards God. According to Adeyemi, "As an art scholar, reaching fifty years of age, which this exhibition commemorates, is a significant milestone, especially when one considers entering the second half of life, following the biblical lifespan of three score and ten."

The solo exhibition, commencing today at the Quintessence gallery in Ikoyi, undoubtedly unveils the creative brilliance inherent in Adeyemi’s works, influenced by his thoughts and cultural environment.

With over 13 solo exhibitions and more than 30 group exhibitions, both locally and internationally, this exhibition highlights the artist's close connection with nature and his documentation of unfolding events.

His recent workshop and exhibition in Sweden have positively influenced his style, leading to the creation of new and distinctive works. His pieces incorporate deep etching, serigraphy, and are influenced by his Yoruba heritage.

During today's exhibition opening, Adeyemi will showcase over 35 works, including pieces like Ancestral Mask, Wheel of Fortune, Bountiful Harvest, Praise God, Fragment of Tradition, and the Village Square, among others. The Mask of Honour symbolizes how masks serve as a window through which the world perceives Africa. Adeyemi explains that the concept of masks embodies festivity and celebration, stating, "These works were crafted to document African traditions for future generations." He further elaborated that Fragment of Tradition aims to depict the recognition of elders in society.

During a preview of the exhibition last week, Adeyemi revealed that the exhibition holds significance as it provides a platform for him to translate his thoughts and perceptions into a vision of what art should represent.

Culture and environment play pivotal roles in Adeyemi’s works, as he believes that reflecting on culture and past experiences, coupled with a constant pursuit of new ideas, has resulted in a fruitful creative journey. He expressed, "My works reflect my passion for exploring the world around me artistically. The current phase of my work is characterized by semi-abstraction, with images becoming more intricate through the incorporation of various elements, rendering my recent works more qualitative in thematic, stylistic, and formal presentation."

Adeyemi, who received mentorship from distinguished art masters such as Professor Yusuf Grillo, Bruce Onabrakpeya, S. I Wagboje, Dan Ikhu Omovbude, and Dr. Fowowe, has been lauded by friends and colleagues as a bridge builder, attentive listener, and highly creative artist. Oshin Ademola from the National Gallery of Art, Lagos, likened Adeyemi's skills to those of the masters, attributing the dynamic changes in art styles to his unquenchable thirst for knowledge.

A notable trait attributed to Adeyemi by many art enthusiasts is his philanthropic spirit. Moses Ohiomokhare, the Curator of Quintessence gallery, commended his philanthropy, citing his donation of several works to the Federal Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, after an exhibition two years ago. Ohiomokhare further mentioned that to mark his fiftieth birthday this year, Adeyemi plans to offer scholarships to students and launch his book.

Adeyoro, a Professor of Industrial Design and Visual Arts, described Adeyemi as someone who prioritizes solving others' problems financially or otherwise over his own, emphasizing his caring nature.

Since the beginning of his career, Adeyemi has seamlessly integrated painting and printmaking. He advocates for style diversity, believing that sticking to a single style can be limiting. As a talented artist and lecturer at Yaba College of Technology, Adeyemi appreciates and values variety in art.

Adeyemi demonstrates versatility in his choice of materials and techniques, ensuring a balanced compositional arrangement. Titled "Dispatches from My Art," this exhibition marks Adeyemi's third solo exhibition at Quintessence gallery and promises to bring a refreshing ambiance to the gallery. The event will also serve as the launch of his book, "New Wine."

Embarking on his creative journey many years ago, Adeyemi has successfully merged the Yaba style with traditional arts from Benin and Yoruba cultures.

Describing his works as a portrayal of cultural practices, Tola Wewe, the Ondo State commissioner of culture and tourism, remarked that Adeyemi's art narrates stories of past and present generations. Wewe emphasized that Adeyemi's intelligent use of motifs vividly depicts the maturity he has attained over time.

Undoubtedly, Adeyemi has made substantial contributions to the art scene in Nigeria. Apart from his involvement in training students through workshops, he has achieved significant milestones during his tenure as the chairman of the Society of Nigeria Artists, Lagos State.

At the age of fifty, Adeyemi acknowledges that there is still much to be accomplished. He expressed gratitude for the journey thus far, acknowledging that there are numerous unfulfilled dreams, yet remains optimistic about the future.

Adeyemi believes that art has greatly enriched the country, but asserts that the government has not reciprocated this generosity in supporting the art industry. He urges the government to prioritize creating a conducive environment for the arts to thrive. He advocates for the integration of arts education across all regions of the country and emphasizes the need for the government to take the National Endowment Fund for the Arts seriously. Adeyemi stressed, "The government must prioritize the Endowment Fund for the arts and actively educate the public about the significance of arts."

Offering advice to emerging artists, Adeyemi encourages sincerity in their craft, hard work, and a focus on contributing positively to the nation. He emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and innovation, urging them to consider what they can offer the country rather than solely expecting support from the nation.
