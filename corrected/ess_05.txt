INTRODUCTION
The study of meaning is a challenging exercise. Meaning has been viewed as the most elusive and controversial phenomenon in language study. Its vague nature allows for diverse interpretations depending on the speaker, the hearer, and the situation. Philosophers, anthropologists, and linguists have attempted to provide solutions to the unstable and ambiguous nature of meaning but have not been successful. Due to the complexity of meaning, several problems are associated with its analysis in natural languages. Various theories of meaning have been proposed to tackle these issues. This paper aims to discuss some of the problems linked to the analysis of meaning and a current theory that reasonably addresses these problems.

PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANALYSIS OF MEANING IN NATURAL LANGUAGES
There are particular problems related to the analysis of meaning in natural languages. Some of these problems are discussed below. The problem of graded boundaries poses a challenge to the proper analysis of meaning in natural languages. Jackendoff (1996), cited in Udofot (2004: 140), observes:
"In talking about the color 'red' in English, one is faced with a broad range of hues from orange to lavender, creating difficulties in distinguishing where orange ends and lavender begins."
According to her, there are borderline cases where a particular color can be perceived as red, orange, or lavender depending on the context. Similar issues exist with words like "fat": What defines the lower boundary of a fat woman? At what point can a woman be described as thin, medium, or fat? These questions are relevant to the problem of graded boundaries.

Ambiguity is another problem encountered in the analysis of meaning in natural languages. Ambiguous words or utterances can be interpreted in various ways depending on the linguistic context. For example, the expression "she is nice" can have different interpretations. The word "nice" could mean "caring, kind, accommodating, beautiful," or other virtues. Another aspect of ambiguity arises when an utterance requires a true or false response that may not always be definitive. Lyons (1977: 169) notes: "If there is a possible world in which a sentence is both true and false, we can say that the sentence expresses two distinct propositions."

Another problem in meaning analysis is that concepts that do not exist for a particular person or group may not be present in their speech and may lack a name or meaning for them (Udofot 2004: 136). This implies that objects referred to in speech only have meaning when they are within the knowledge of the speaker or hearer. If such objects are mentioned outside the knowledge of the listener(s), it poses a serious problem for analysis.

Similarly, the absence of shared knowledge, beliefs, conventions, and presuppositions between the speaker and the hearer can present a significant challenge in the analysis of the meaning of a given utterance. The presence of these contextual features is crucial for interpreting an utterance correctly.

Subjectivity and introspection of concepts also pose challenges in obtaining objective meanings of words and utterances if everyone must delve into their own minds. Haas (1973: 20) states that "an empirical science like linguistics cannot rely on a procedure of looking into their minds; each into his own." Some theories define meaning in terms of "symbol-image-referent relationships," which only apply to concrete things, not abstractions. For instance, mental images of concepts like liberty, air, or courage cannot be visualized.

Moreover, the diversity of ideas individuals hold about things presents a challenge in meaning analysis. Udofot (2004) suggests that "a well-described picture can be perceived differently by different people depending on their intellectual capacities, power of imagination, and backgrounds" (p. 62). People may interpret things differently based on their experiences and perspectives.

Furthermore, not all concepts are observable, which complicates meaning analysis. Abstract nouns, for instance, are not tangible. Explaining a word like "nice" by using terms like beautiful, handsome, or charming assumes that the hearer already understands the meanings of these words stored in their mind.

Interpreting meaning solely based on the visual image conjured by the hearer is another limitation in meaning analysis. While visualizing objects like a hen or duck might provide a simple distinction, scientifically describing differences using terms like "long neck" is more accurate.

Additionally, propositions can vary based on the time and place of utterance, as every utterance occurs within a specific spatio-temporal context. Lack of knowledge of these contextual elements can impede meaningful analysis.

Lastly, many expressions in natural languages do not have single referents, leading to potential ambiguities. For example, the expression "that young man is my brother" may require consideration of the speaker's identity and the reference's relationship. Understanding the extent of the relationship between the speaker and the referent can be challenging.

A CURRENT THEORY ADDRESSING THESE PROBLEMS
A recommended current theory that reasonably addresses the aforementioned problems associated with the analysis of meaning in natural languages is pragmatics. According to Levinson (1983: 24), pragmatics is the "ability of language users to pair sentences with the context in which they would be appropriate." Pragmatics offers a user-centered description of language.

Pragmatics theory enables the interpretation not only of the literal meaning of an utterance but also the nuances derived from formality and politeness. It incorporates the context, culture, deixis, presuppositions, implicatures, and paralinguistic features in understanding meaning. Pragmatics provides a comprehensive analysis that considers both observable and unobservable aspects of language events, reflecting the choices and constraints language users encounter in social interactions.

CONCLUSION
This paper has examined the problems associated with the analysis of meaning in natural language, including issues with graded boundaries, ambiguity, shared knowledge, subjectivity, perception, and multiple referents. Pragmatics has been identified as a current theory that effectively addresses these challenges.
