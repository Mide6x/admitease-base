Omatek Unveils World’s Smallest Desktop PC

Indigenous computer manufacturer Omatek Ventures Plc unveiled the smallest desktop PC, named the Omatek Handtop PC.

According to the company, this product is the first of its kind to be launched in Africa. It is a compact 8-inch desktop based on typical and powerful notebook components, requiring minimal desk space.

Mrs. Florence Seriki, the Group Managing Director of Omatek, stated that the Omatek Handtop offers great value for those seeking a basic PC for tasks such as managing photos, sending emails, surfing the web, and other common activities. She described the Omatek Handtop PC as a versatile 3-in-one system that can serve as a presentation screen or TV monitor when mounted behind a Plasma/LCD. It also allows executives to surf the web.

The machine is equipped with Intel’s new power-efficient 1.6 GHz Atom processor, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, and a 160GB 5400rpm 2.5-inch SATA hard drive. Additionally, it features an integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics card with shared video memory.

Mrs. Seriki stated, "The Omatek Handtop PC demonstrates strong gaming performance in PC World Bench tests. It is also energy-efficient, consuming only 15 to 20 watts of power, which is lower than most notebooks."

The Omatek Handtop PC supports various platforms like Windows XP Home, XP Pro, Windows Vista Basic, or Mandriva Linux. It includes a stand, mount kit, and comes with a wireless keyboard and mouse, with an optional display unit.

Mrs. Seriki emphasized that the PC is useful for executives as a mobile desktop, valuable for home and small office users as a compact work tool, and handy for students as a rugged yet efficient e-learning tool supported by Omatek resource centers established in many Nigerian institutions.

She highlighted her company's pioneering efforts in introducing new technologies to the PC market, stemming from being the first Completely Knocked Down factory in Africa, sourcing components from top-tier factories in Asia.

Mrs. Seriki affirmed that Omatek will continue to strive to be Africa’s leading solutions provider.
