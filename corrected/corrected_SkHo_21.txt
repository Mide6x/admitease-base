CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS: Avoiding Scalp Burns
It is possible to apply relaxing creams without burning the scalp. These products are commonly available, but it's important to remember that these straightening agents are potent chemicals that should not be underestimated.

To avoid scalp burns, it is crucial to be attentive to the stylist's approach during the process. Speed is important, but concentration is key to ensure that the cream does not touch the scalp until the process is nearly complete. Any negligence can lead to burns once the cream comes into contact with the scalp.

The Angel’s Studio HAIR CLINIC guide to a 'burn-free-perm' includes several recommendations:
- Understand your hair and scalp characteristics.
- Avoid shampooing for 7 to 14 days before a touch-up.
- Refrain from removing braids or weaves at least 7 days before a touch-up.
- Avoid swimming at least 7 days before a touch-up to prevent burns on the hairline.
- Do not massage, scratch, or stimulate the scalp in any way up to 7 days before a touch-up.
- Check for bruises and abrasions on the scalp before applying chemicals.
- Apply petroleum jelly to the entire scalp about 24 hours before the application.
- Avoid wearing headgear for at least 3 days before to prevent burning the edges.
- Schedule the application in the morning to prevent perspiration on the scalp.
- Avoid using gels, spritz, and sprays on the hair the week of your touch-up.
- Consult a professional to determine the ideal product for your hair.
- Use the appropriate strength of product for your hair type.
- Refrain from massaging the hair while the chemical is on it; let the cream straighten the hair.
- Avoid combing the hair while applying the cream to prevent the comb-teeth from touching the scalp.

The best advice is to always seek the services of a professional for touch-ups to prevent scalp burns that could potentially lead to bald patches due to follicle damage. Prompt attention to burns is crucial to prevent infection, and seeking medical help may be necessary.

War Against Dandruff
The Anti-Dandruff treatment starts with a dry scalp, contrary to common practice. The FLAKE KONTROL shampoo must be applied to a dry scalp for optimal results. As a Trichologist, my goal is to address hair and scalp issues using effective techniques and products to promote healthy hair. Patricia, who followed the Anti-Dandruff treatment kit instructions, noticed a significant improvement after just the second application.

Clients with chronic dandruff have posed a challenge, but achieving at least 3 weeks of a flake-free scalp is possible with the right approach. The FLAKE KONTROL shampoo, when used as directed, has proven to be effective. It is essential to apply the shampoo to a dry scalp for thorough cleansing; applying to wet hair may not fully clear flakes.

The FLAKE KONTROL scalp cream is beneficial for promoting a healthy scalp for both men and women, not limited to those with dandruff. At Angel’s Studio HAIR CLINIC, we use the scalp cream for all clients as it contains natural ingredients like coconut oil, Shea butter, hemp oil, jojoba oil, and peppermint oil to alleviate any itching. The scalp cream aids in promoting scalp health, moisture retention, and hair growth when paired with scalp massage.

Understanding Makeup
Organic or Inorganic
Makeup is a versatile tool for enhancing one's features to achieve natural or high-fashion looks. The key to a natural look is to enhance features without appearing heavily made-up. Makeup should enhance your appearance while maintaining your natural look. It's essential to harmonize the tones and application techniques to achieve a natural result that enhances your attractiveness.

The term 'natural' cosmetics are often used for marketing, but completely natural makeup products do not exist due to the need for preservatives to prevent deterioration. While plant oils have benefits, they usually require dilution to avoid greasiness and irritation. Inorganic pigments are necessary for color stability in makeup exposed to sunlight.

While there may be concerns about using chemicals in cosmetics, advancements in skincare research have led to significant benefits. It is essential to balance the use of scientifically developed products with traditional plant-based remedies to leverage the advantages of both approaches.
