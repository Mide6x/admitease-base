Pragmatic Technologies Unveils CyberPower Inverter

Have you ever desired the ability to sleep with your fan or AC on, power your computers, keep your food frozen, and watch your favorite TV shows without the typical generator noise? This scenario may only be possible if the Nigerian power authority went nuclear, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon. So, what options do you have? Introducing the Inverter.

Pragmatic Technologies, a prominent technology solutions provider in Nigeria and the operator of BuyRight online Gadget store, has partnered with CyberPower Inc, a global leader in inverter solutions. They recently launched the CyberPower Inverter at a press conference in Lagos.

The CyberPower Inverter is designed as a consumer-oriented power solution to address the power challenges faced by Nigerians in homes and offices nationwide. Various forms of inverter solutions have been available in the Nigerian market for some time, but they have not adequately met the needs of the average power consumer.

According to Biodun Marquis, the Managing Director of Pragmatic Technologies, "the CyberPower inverter is maintenance-free, provides automatic power switching from mains to batteries and vice versa, and operates with low input DC voltage."

Marquis further explains, "One crucial aspect of an inverter is the type of batteries used with it. Many of our competitors require high input DC voltage, typically a minimum of 4 - 8 12-volt batteries for a 3KVa inverter. The unique feature of the CyberPower inverter is its ability to provide power with just two batteries for the 3 KVa model and four batteries for the 5KVa model. Some individuals attempt to cut costs by using car batteries with inverters. It is essential to note that car batteries are not safe for this purpose and are not designed for inverter use. We strongly recommend deep cycle batteries, which are available for purchase at BuyRight."

"In today's market, we see various inverters being imported or locally assembled. Understanding the capabilities of an inverter is crucial for making the right investment. The CyberPower inverter offers the lowest cost-to-benefit ratio globally. It features faster charging â€“ twice as fast as local competition. Additionally, you can easily expand its capacity by gradually adding batteries over time at your discretion, based on your budget. Our inverter also functions as a stabilizer and a UPS, providing unmatched versatility."
