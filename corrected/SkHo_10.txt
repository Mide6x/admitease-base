Define your relationships clearly to avoid attributing blame to others. Before I began writing this piece, it seemed as though every topic concerning women had been thoroughly discussed. Can you believe that? It appeared that there was nothing more to add for women to learn from until Esther's story inspired me. It became clear that any piece that could potentially save a life is worth writing about.

I deeply empathize with Esther, but how could one even consider taking their own life? I aim to express this without judgment, but I find the idea abhorrent.

During our teenage years, many of us believed that someone cared for us even without expressing it. This is a common part of adolescence, a time when we have not yet fully matured to understand that feelings should be clarified, and someone's attraction may not equate to love.

You may have heard the saying, "Assumption is the mother of ignorance." About five years ago, a woman I knew met a man on her way to work. They developed a close friendship, and he showered her with gifts. Working in the same complex as the man, we became close friends as well. Our bond extended beyond the workplace, and we visited each other's homes. While she was content with her guardians, she longed to be in a different situation, believing that the grass is always greener on the other side.

Despite her guardians' kindness, she felt unappreciated, as she was burdened with household chores while their own children pursued personal interests. She expressed her desire to get married and escape her current predicament. I advised her against rushing into marriage, as it should not be seen as a solution to her problems.

As Shola's interactions with Ope intensified, she began discussing marriage more frequently. Concerned about the pace of their relationship, I probed about Ope's past relationships. It became apparent that she assumed their relationship was exclusive without any evidence.

Ope eventually impregnated Shola, revealing his marital status when confronted by her guardians. He distanced himself, leaving Shola to care for their child alone.

Esther, residing in the Eastern part of the country, faced a similar predicament. Despite being well-treated by her guardians, she encountered betrayal from someone she trusted.

Esther's encounter with Abu in Lagos led to a series of unfortunate events, including abuse and contracting HIV. Overwhelmed by guilt, she contemplated suicide, vowing to infect others before ending her own life.

It is crucial to establish clear boundaries in relationships. Misinterpreting friendly gestures as romantic interest can lead to misunderstandings and heartache. Understanding the distinction between desire and genuine affection is essential.

Let us extend our support and encouragement to Esther during this challenging time. She undoubtedly requires all the assistance and kindness she can receive.
