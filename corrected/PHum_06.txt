Fact of history that binds Igbo and Yoruba
Over the years, there have been various assertions by some Igbo and Yoruba leaders suggesting possible cultural, linguistic, and sociological connections between the two ethnic groups. Historians, sociologists, archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, and other scholars in the humanities have presented arguments showing that the Igbos and the Yorubas share a common linguistic and historical ancestry.

This claim is now widely accepted due to the abundance of evidence available today demonstrating that these two groups share significant cultural and linguistic similarities. Some of these pieces of evidence are readily available.

In his latest book, titled "How Yoruba and Igbo Became Different Languages," Dr. Bolaji Aremo from Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile Ife, Osun State, provides numerous examples connecting the two ethnic groups linguistically. This research heavily relies on modern chronology, examples, and other antiquities to support his claim and clarify the historical record.

Despite some critics finding this claim inconsistent with apparent differences between the two groups, historical evidence of affiliation and similarities cannot be overlooked or disputed. This is what inspired the author, a linguist himself, to delve into this research.

Dr. Aremo was initially intrigued by the idea of a genetic relationship between Yoruba and Igbo when a childhood friend pointed out similarities in words for well-known body parts in both languages. For instance, Yoruba "Imu" corresponds to Igbo "imi," both meaning nose. Similarly, Yoruba "eti" corresponds to Igbo "nti," both meaning ear, and Yoruba "enu" corresponds to Igbo "onu," both meaning mouth. Other similarities include Yoruba "orun" and Igbo "onu" for neck, among others. Later in his academic life, he learned in a language class that Igbo, Yoruba, and many other African languages belong to the same language family, originating from a common ancestor or parent language.

To make these observations more compelling and believable, the author meticulously explores various areas of similarity, providing examples that withstand scrutiny and challenge even the most skeptical critics. His references to other historical and linguistic works in this field not only lend credibility but also demonstrate that these facts are evident for all to see.

The languages being tonal, with the application of tone levels significantly affecting meaning, many words exhibit striking similarities in either meaning or connotation. This aspect underscores the beauty of this research, which, if further explored, could lead to more discoveries benefiting both ethnic groups in recognizing their shared heritage.

In addition to the linguistic perspective, historians are urged to delve deeper into uncovering more facts in this area. The author challenges other academics in the humanities to surpass his efforts in exploring historical and linguistic connections between Igbo and Yoruba for a more comprehensive and celebrated understanding.

In chapter two, the author highlights similarities in body parts between Yoruba and Igbo, where the jaw and cheek, for example, are categorized similarly as "agba onu" in Igbo and "egbe enu" in Yoruba. Other examples include armpit ("abiya" in Yoruba, "abu" in Igbo), intestines/stomach ("ifun" in Yoruba, "afo" or "avo" in Igbo), and hand ("aka" in Igbo, "apa" in Yoruba).

The book delves into common actions and processes in chapter three, such as weeping or tears ("akwa" in Igbo, "ekun" in Yoruba) and further nuances like cry of sorrow or extreme grief, showing similarities between the two languages.

Throughout the following chapters, the author explores various areas of commonality and divergence in Igbo and Yoruba languages, emphasizing shared ancestry through linguistic connections. Despite some errors and misrepresentations, this academic work serves as a foundational resource for understanding language classification in the Kwa language group, to which both Yoruba and Igbo languages belong. Dr. Aremo's book effectively establishes the longstanding historical fact of the shared linguistic link between Igbo and Yoruba, supported by compelling evidence.
