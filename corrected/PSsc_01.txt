Nigerians are expressing their concerns about the increasing incidents of child sexual abuse. Concerned citizens gathered at a two-day consultative meeting organized by the Media Concern Initiative for Women and Children (MEDIACON) in Lagos, where they raised alarm over the growing prevalence of child sexual abuse in the country. They lamented that many offenders remain unpunished due to the insufficient timeframe for prosecution.

During an interview with Good Health Weekly, Mrs. Omotola Rotimi, the Director of the Office of the Public Defenders (OPD) in Lagos State, stated that the existing law does not allow enough time for prosecuting offenders. Rotimi explained that the law only allows for a two-month period for prosecuting offenders, making it challenging to hold them accountable. She revealed that out of numerous cases, only five offenders have been prosecuted due to various constraints such as timing, lack of forensic evidence, reluctance of parents to allow their children to testify, and social stigma.

Rotimi emphasized the need for extending the prosecution timeframe from two months to five years in Nigeria to effectively bring offenders to justice and hold them accountable for their actions. She highlighted constraints such as social stigma and the lack of DNA facilities in the country as contributing factors to the challenges in addressing child sexual abuse.

Princess Olufemi Kayode, the Executive Director of MEDIACON, stressed the importance of communication and raising awareness as vital tools in combating child and sexual abuse. The meeting aimed to educate market traders on the significance of being well-informed, educating their children, and preventing such harmful situations around young individuals. Kayode noted that recent awareness efforts have led more Nigerians to speak out about the issue, unlike in the past.

Parents and guardians were urged to educate both boys and girls about sexuality to prevent abuse. Kayode emphasized the importance of discussing sex education with children to help them understand the consequences of what they see in media and newspapers, rather than ignoring or scolding them.

Participants in the meeting, including Alhaja Risikat Abdulkareem, the Iyaloja General of Ojokoro Local Government, and Alhaji Yusuf Adebowale, the Vice Baba Loja Lagos State, acknowledged the severity of child and sexual abuse. They pledged to relay the messages to their members during monthly meetings to contribute to reducing the prevalence of sexual abuse.
