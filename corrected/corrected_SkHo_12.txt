Do not borrow money to appear extravagant. Nigerians have a unique admiration for flamboyance. It is fascinating; everyone desires to look good and live like a Hollywood star.

There is no issue with wanting to look good, but the concern arises when individuals borrow money to maintain appearances. Looking good for us extends to the house we live in, the car we drive, the clubs we frequent, the people we socialize with, the shoes we wear, and everything in between. Consider this: if someone must go into debt to meet these obligations, it becomes problematic. We are not discussing basic necessities like food or clothing but rather excessive vanity. Many individuals find themselves in debt and unnecessary troubles. We must take a step back, reflect, and shift our mindset.

Listen carefully! You are here to fulfill your own destiny, which is not tied to anyone else's destiny. You are not in competition with others. Your focus should be on living well. Trust me, living well is achievable and should not be stressful if we all learn to live within our means. Essentially, what I am emphasizing is living within your financial capabilities.

We can all agree that everyone has the ability to earn a living. Even an artisan in Nigeria makes at least two thousand naira a day, and labor is valued at a minimum of one thousand naira daily. It is established that everyone can work; there is something each person can do to earn money without being condescending. The issue lies in the desire of many people to start off at a grand scale.

Your neighbor or friend might be considered a 'big boy' or 'big girl,' and you feel pressured to keep up without understanding the sacrifices they made to reach that status. Many individuals possess enough resources to meet their needs but feel compelled to showcase extravagance. Who truly cares?

We need to shift our mindset and acknowledge that we are not in competition with others in this world. It is disheartening to see many individuals striving for luxury items without considering their financial capacity. If you can truly afford luxury items, then there is no issue with indulging in them.

Utilize what you have to acquire what you need. Purchase shoes if you need them, opt for functional wristwatches, and if you can comfortably pay your rent without borrowing money, then you are living well and within your means. Too many individuals feel the need to purchase a more expensive car when they can comfortably afford a simpler one. There is nothing wrong with appreciating what you have and being content.

Learn from others' experiences. Be content with where you are at present while striving for growth. Embrace and appreciate your current position while aspiring to achieve more. Contentment is key to living a fulfilling life.

Reflect on individuals in African countries who made sacrifices to improve their circumstances. They worked odd jobs in Nigeria during difficult times and returned to their country when conditions improved. They now lead modest lives, driving functional vehicles and residing in small homes. Their contentment is admirable.

Avoid putting unnecessary pressure on yourself. Live for yourself and find joy in what you have. Embrace contentment as you navigate through life.
