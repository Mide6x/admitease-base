The Play "Awhangan"
"Awhangan" is a depiction of the true-life historical struggle of the ancient people of Agbathegreme. It portrays a military warlord celebrating victory in a battle, highlighting collectivism, unity, brotherhood, courage, and the strength of the masses against dictators and tyrants. The protagonist, a renowned warrior known as the fearless stone and husband of the Tigress, is manipulated as a tool of revenge to overthrow the Aholu (king) to settle a longstanding vendetta. Although successful as a warrior, Awhangan fails as a king.

The play honors traditional democracy through a historical drama of heroism, greed, loyalty, and betrayal, showcasing a community's collective resistance against tyranny without resorting to violence.

"Awhangan" poses thought-provoking questions: What is the destiny of a people who forget their past? What lies ahead for a society that disregards its history? What kind of leadership can a nation expect if it neglects to educate its youth about their past heroes?

Notable playwrights like Prof. Wole Soyinka, Ola Rotimi, Femi Osofisan, among others, have imparted significant historical and human experiences to Nigerians and Africans. The theater stands out for its profound contributions to learning.

In a renowned lecture, esteemed historian Prof. Kenneth Dike remarked, "People who are unaware of their past cannot comprehend the present and will be ill-prepared for the future." Thus, it is crucial for individuals to acknowledge pivotal events and preserve them for future generations.

President Barack Obama may have drawn inspiration from the timeless, forward-thinking oratory of Martin Luther King, culminating in the realization of the African-American dream. History serves to inspire the new generation for the betterment of the future.

Would it not be detrimental for the Ogu people of Agbathegreme to erase their history by neglecting their historical literature? Together, we must reject marginalization, militancy, election fraud, self-imposition, embezzlement, corruption, human exploitation, power outages, and vandalism, and instead embrace peace and unity.

"Awhangan," a real-life play, aims to nurture and influence the youth.
