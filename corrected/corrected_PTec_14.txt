NTA Lagos pioneers internet television broadcast.
Almost 50 years since the launch of television broadcast in Nigeria, Nigerian Television Authority's Lagos Channel 10 station unveiled Nigeria's first television station internet portal over the weekend. Science and Technology Editor O'Seun Ogunseitan reports on the event with Charles Adewale, Seinde Eledumo, Adekunle Adenle, Kemi Oyero, and Jumoke Onasanya.

Television broadcasts, including live transmissions from Nigeria, can now be viewed on the internet. The Lagos Channel 10 station of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) introduced the tool for this over the weekend.

In the presence of a small gathering at its Tejuoso, Lagos station, NTA Channel 10 launched Nigerian broadcasting into the cutting-edge of digital broadcast. The audience, which included stakeholders in the broadcast and telecommunications industry, witnessed the launch of a live portal website www.nta10lagos.com.

Through the website, NTA television broadcasts can be watched anywhere in the world with internet service available. This groundbreaking feat was conceived and executed by Nigerians.

The launch potentially marked Nigeria's initial steps towards readiness for internet-based television broadcast, technically known as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV).

An official Nigerian Broadcasting Commission response at the event indicated that the government might have acknowledged the end of broadcast territory regulation, ushering in a new era where today's broadcast territory regulator may transition into a broadcast content monitor rather than a content regulator.

The NTA online portal essentially functions as a large internet website hosting smaller websites. The station's management is offering free advertising to businesses and individuals looking to reach out through the station.

The project was carried out by a Nigerian-owned company, MicroRes Nigeria Ltd, a significant technical player in the internet service delivery industry. The execution took place through a private-public sector partnership arrangement.

By registering on the website, skilled individuals, upcoming musicians, and other artists can anticipate adoption and promotion by the television station.

Mr. Shakiru Rufai, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of MicroRes Ltd, expressed the goal of the portal to become Nigeria's most patronized by combining NTA's unparalleled reach with an interactive website meeting the social networking and professional needs of young people, igniting maximum business and vocational interest in Nigerians of all ages concerning Nigerian affairs.

Rufai mentioned that the portal offers free classified advertisements, digital media consultancy services like web design and hosting, along with high-end digital age services such as web broadcast and global SMS broadcast.

Furthermore, the portal will live-stream events like Annual General Meetings of Nigerian companies, allowing shareholders to participate even if they are abroad.

A company listing and business directory are available online for direct updates by business owners, along with a listing for schools and educational institutions. Data verification will be conducted in partnership with the private national databank, The Nation Databank, which will also publish the data on its monthly free public video and data discs.

NTA Lagos Channel 10, originally Nigeria Television Service (NTS) Lagos, later renamed NBC TV Lagos in October 1976 and then NTA Lagos in April 1977. In January 1978, the station was named NTA Channel 10, Lagos, becoming one of the constituent stations of the new southwestern broadcast zone of the national television network. The current NTA Lagos, under the Lagos Zonal Centre, emerged from the old NTA Lagos in 2007.

The NTA Lagos internet portal project, tagged "Beyond Broadcasting," was initiated under the former general manager of the television station, Mrs. Elizabeth Iyabosola Aina Scott, now the zonal director of the national television network in Ibadan. Her successor, Mr. Sunday Olaitan Owolabi, who assumed office last May, oversaw the project to completion.

Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria, commended the management of NTA not only for launching the project but for seeing it through seamlessly under two administrations in a short timeframe. Dr. Ekuwem pledged the telecommunications industry's support for the new portal to ensure a smooth transition for the next generation of Nigerian communications technology specialists.

To dispel concerns of project failure, Dr. Ekuwem advised NTA to provide full support for the project, acknowledging the proficiency of the young men and women involved in conceptualizing and executing it.

The station's General Manager assured continuous support from the NTA management for the project, recognizing its potential to fulfill key objectives by granting autonomy to NTA stations in certain aspects of their operations.

Television broadcasting via the internet is expected to attract a larger audience than traditional television broadcast mainly due to lower capital requirements. At the lower end, even non-professional journalists with basic camcorders and internet access can broadcast video clips with minimal effort. Established television stations like NTA can transmit to the internet with just an internet connection, making their broadcasts accessible worldwide.

With nearly two billion people owning internet-ready GSM phones and power challenges in many developing countries, internet television broadcasts are poised to gain more followers than conventional broadcasts. As television broadcast goes fully digital globally by 2015, the proliferation of small television stations is expected, eliminating the need for analogue transmitters and licensing requirements.
