Still Fighting Against Polio

"I used to be against immunization, but now I am willing to advocate for it, and I urge everyone to ensure that their children are immunized," said Mallam Abubakar of Limanchi Kona Zazzau in Zaria Local Government in Kaduna State. Abubakar's son was diagnosed with polio in 2008 after he had previously refused to have the child vaccinated.

Mallam Mukhtar Sani, from the same area, whose daughter Saratu also suffers from polio due to non-compliance, stated, "When her illness began, we were unable to sleep because we were unaware of the cause until it was diagnosed as polio at the hospital. Initially, someone in our community had advised against immunizing her. She has since received treatment and medication and can now walk short distances intermittently, though not as she used to. I urge all of us to embrace immunization and ensure that our children are vaccinated," he expressed in the Hausa language when journalists, health officials from the World Health Organization (WHO), and representatives from the Kaduna State Action Committee on Immunization (SACI) visited his area during a polio awareness campaign.

The growing awareness among individuals who were previously staunchly opposed to immunization for their children due to advice from traditional and religious leaders is a result of the efforts of 32 journalists in Kaduna. Concerned about children being paralyzed due to parental refusal to vaccinate them, these journalists formed the Journalists Against Polio (JAP) to raise awareness about the importance of immunization in Kaduna State and the northern region. Their goal is to expose government officials who only pay lip service to the fight against polio and to support those genuinely working to eradicate the disease.

The havoc caused by polio in Nigeria, particularly in Kaduna State, is alarming. The virus is highly contagious, with every infected child putting 200 others at risk. Nigeria, accounting for 90% of global polio cases, has faced challenges eradicating the disease due to groups opposing vaccination, particularly in the north. Additionally, health workers' sabotage has hindered progress, leading to accusations of re-infecting neighboring African countries that had previously eliminated the virus.

Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, has been a silent endemic pathogen for centuries, causing major epidemics and fatalities in the late 19th century. The disease, transmitted through contaminated water or food, primarily affects children, leading to paralysis and, in severe cases, death. The development of polio vaccines in the 1950s significantly reduced global polio cases, but challenges persist in Nigeria, India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

Efforts to combat polio in Kaduna State are crucial, given the rising number of cases. Challenges such as inadequate vaccination coverage, insufficient healthcare staff, and misinformation about vaccines have hindered progress. JAP's intervention and collaboration with stakeholders are essential to address these issues and improve immunization rates in the state.

The involvement of journalists in the fight against polio, as demonstrated by JAP's activities, has garnered attention, including from Bill Gates. Gates, through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has committed substantial funds to combat polio and other diseases, emphasizing the media's role in raising awareness and advocating for disease eradication.

In conclusion, eradicating polio in Nigeria requires genuine commitment from all stakeholders, as highlighted by the Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency. Collaboration, awareness campaigns, and addressing challenges such as misinformation and inadequate healthcare infrastructure are crucial steps toward achieving a polio-free Nigeria.
