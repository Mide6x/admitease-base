Common Male Reproductive System Issues

Boys may encounter various reproductive system problems, such as:

Disorders of the Scrotum, Testicles, or Epididymis:
Issues affecting the contents of the scrotum may involve the testicles, epididymis, or the scrotum itself.

Testicular trauma:
Even minor injuries to the testicles can lead to severe pain, bruising, or swelling. Testicular injuries often occur during sports or due to other trauma. Testicular torsion, where a testicle twists around, cutting off its blood supply, is a less common problem that some teenage males may experience, requiring surgery to untwist the cord and save the testicle.

Varicocele:
This condition involves a varicose vein in the network of veins connected to the testicles. Varicoceles typically develop during puberty and, while usually not harmful, can potentially harm the testicle or reduce sperm production. If your son is concerned about changes in his testicles, it is advisable to consult his doctor.

Testicular cancer:
Among men under 40, testicular cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers. It occurs when cells in the testicle divide abnormally, forming a tumor that can spread to other body parts. Early detection significantly improves the chances of a cure. Encouraging teenage boys to learn self-examination techniques is recommended.

Epididymitis:
This condition entails inflammation of the epididymis, the coiled tubes linking the testes with the vas deferens. It is commonly caused by infections like the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia, resulting in pain and swelling near one of the testicles.

Hydrocele:
When fluid accumulates in the membranes surrounding the testes, a hydrocele occurs. While hydroceles may cause swelling around the testicle, they are typically painless. Surgery may be necessary in some cases to address the condition.

Inguinal hernia:
An inguinal hernia occurs when a portion of the intestines protrudes through a weakened abdominal wall opening into the groin or scrotum. Surgery can correct this condition.

Disorders of the Penis:
Penis-related disorders include:

• Inflammation of the penis:
Symptoms of penile inflammation include redness, itching, swelling, and pain. Balanitis affects the glans (penis head), while posthitis is inflammation of the foreskin, often due to a yeast or bacterial infection.

• Hypospadias:
This disorder involves the urethra opening on the underside of the penis, rather than at the tip.

• Phimosis:
Common in newborns and young children, phimosis is the tightness of the penile foreskin, which typically resolves without treatment. Circumcision may be recommended if it interferes with urination.

• Paraphimosis:
When an uncircumcised boy’s penis is retracted but fails to return to its original position, blood flow to the penis head may be compromised, causing pain and swelling. Lubrication or circumcision may be recommended by a doctor.

• Ambiguous genitalia:
This condition occurs when a child is born with ambiguous genitalia that are not clearly male or female. In most cases in boys, the penis may be underdeveloped or absent, while testicular tissue is present. In rare instances, the child may have both testicular and ovarian tissue.

• Micropenis:
This disorder involves a penis that is normally formed but significantly smaller than average based on standard measurements.
