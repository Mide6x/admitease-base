Climate Change: From Awareness to Adaptation

The year 2007 was more severe and devastating for farmers, nomads, and pastoralists in Kebbi and Gombe States than in previous years. Communities, farmers, and state governments were taken by surprise when heavy rains poured in the second and third quarters of 2007. Consequently, rivers, lakes, and dams overflowed, causing massive floods that destroyed homes, communities, and public institutions.

In Kebbi, the disaster had a significant impact on the communities and residents, resulting in collateral damage to lives and properties. Although no lives were lost, more than 3,000 people were displaced, left homeless, and became refugees in their own land. Children were separated from their fathers, and parents couldn't find their children. Additionally, over 300 homes were destroyed.

Farms were washed away and destroyed prematurely. For pastoralists and nomads, it was a story of 'one loss too many' as many herds of cattle, rams, and goats were lost or swept away to unknown locations. Even after the flood, various diseases emerged, increasing the immediate costs. Efforts were made at different levels to address the effects of the floods.

Later in the year, there was a sharp increase in food prices. Reports indicated that food prices had risen by an average of 30% within the last six months. Before the end of the season, the surge escalated to an average of 45%. This surge was partly due to a shortage of food supplies and production caused by the flood. However, other factors contributed to the food crisis and shortages apart from the natural disaster.

This issue is not unique to Nigeria; other parts of the world have also been severely affected. In Asia, countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand have suffered from massive floods in recent years. In South America, Brazil has faced similar challenges, and both the United States and United Kingdom have also been impacted. Like Nigeria, countries such as Malawi, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and Mozambique are among the worst-hit, indicating that Africa is also vulnerable to floods.

These challenges have been linked to climate change. In response to the need to reduce the impacts of climate change on communities, homes, and public institutions, organizations like the Environment and Development in the Third World (ENDA), Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), and IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) have collaborated with the Institute of Development Studies to establish AfricaAdapt.

AfricaAdapt, created to reduce human vulnerabilities in the face of climate change threats, is the first pan-African network dedicated to climate change adaptation on the continent, according to FARA coordinator, Ms. Jackeline Nman. Nman emphasized that despite the misery experienced by families and communities over the past decade, the network aims to minimize human suffering and vulnerabilities caused by climate change.

Acknowledging some constraints in achieving its set objectives, Nman stated that AfricaAdapt aims to bridge linguistic and geographical divides to ensure that knowledge that can assist vulnerable communities in adapting to climate change is accessible to all seeking responses to climate change. The network employs various platforms to raise awareness about climate change and instill a culture of climate adaptation to mitigate its impacts.

Focusing on interactive websites, events, specialized radio broadcasts, and support for innovation, AfricaAdapt facilitates the sharing of knowledge on reducing climate impacts in Nigeria with researchers and vulnerable communities across the continent. The network is open to individuals and organizations working on climate change adaptation in Africa.

By utilizing various communication channels and collaborating with African media, AfricaAdapt seeks to share knowledge with communities to help them adapt to climate change challenges. The network aims to empower local communities to share their knowledge and experiences with other stakeholders addressing climate change impacts in Africa.

The urgency to address the vulnerability of communities and homes to climate change has prompted collaboration among academics, researchers, and scientists to mitigate climate impacts. This collaborative effort was evident during the 38th interdisciplinary research discourse at the University of Ibadan in 2007. At this forum, President of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Emeritus Professor David Okali, highlighted the threat posed by climate change to Nigeria.

Okali outlined the causes of climate change, attributing them to human actions and inactions that disrupt the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation in the earth's atmosphere. He emphasized the significance of greenhouse gases, aerosols, land cover changes, solar activity, and volcanic eruptions in driving climate change.

Stressing the role of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, in the greenhouse effect, Okali underscored the need for sustainable environmental practices to mitigate climate impacts. He warned that Nigeria, despite contributing less to global climate issues, is highly vulnerable to climate change consequences, affecting human lives, health security, water resources, biodiversity, and agricultural activities locally and globally.

Okali urged proactive leadership in managing climate change challenges to ensure a secure future for Nigeria. He highlighted the potential threats posed by climate change, including coastal inundation, desertification, and ecological disruptions, emphasizing the need for multilateral efforts to safeguard the environment and livelihoods.

The implications of climate change on food security, livelihoods, and poverty reduction programs were also discussed by Okali, who emphasized the importance of implementing international agreements like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) to address climate change effectively.
