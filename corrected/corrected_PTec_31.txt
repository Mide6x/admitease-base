Solar Power: Bridging the Gap

Solar power is increasingly becoming a prominent player in the nation's energy landscape. Daniel Essiet examines the opportunities presented by this energy source, often touted as one of the most cost-effective means of power generation.

With the economy suffering from the government's unfulfilled promise to enhance power supply, individuals and corporate entities are facing numerous challenges in effectively managing power supply amidst the crisis. Nigerians face electricity shortages as power stations deteriorate, resulting in businesses struggling due to erratic power supply.

According to Mr. Edun Olamide, Deputy Director of Web Power Continental Services, Nigerians should consider shifting away from electricity utilities that no longer provide consistent power supply. He believes that erratic power supply will hinder Nigerian businesses from thriving and achieving success.

As energy costs continue to burden resources, Olamide asserts that revitalizing power supply is now the most urgent issue confronting individuals and organizations. He, along with other experts, believes that the power situation will not improve as rapidly as it did in the past.

Olamide highlights that solar power offers the potential for affordable electricity and is rapidly evolving with new innovations. Consequently, Nigerians may no longer be reliant on the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN).

In the evolving business landscape, the reliable delivery of energy supply has become increasingly crucial. Olamide emphasizes that, given the current circumstances, solar power is a better fit to reduce operational costs and enhance competitiveness.

With government support, Olamide's company is prepared to harness energy from the sun and other renewable resources to bolster the nation's electricity supply. He suggests that even those unable to afford commercial solar power panels can start with small panels to reduce power consumption gradually.

Olamide envisions that, with advancements in technology, solar systems can help bridge the power supply gap in the country. Amidst declining conditions, solar power system installations could generate substantial revenue and are projected to nearly triple by 2020.

Regarding solar energy utilization, Olamide underscores the importance of energy assessments to tailor the solar power system to the specific energy needs of a property. He explains that the system's size depends on the number of devices requiring power, reserve capacity, and climatic factors.

He notes that the cost of a solar power system varies based on whether it is entirely off-grid. A basic system typically includes a solar panel, inverter, conductor, and battery, costing around N80,000. Olamide recommends installation by trained individuals to ensure proper setup.

Although solar power currently represents a small fraction of energy consumption in Nigeria, the potential for growth is significant. The challenge lies in making solar panels more accessible for homes and offices by addressing the high installation costs that have deterred many homeowners in the past.

Despite the initial expense, Olamide believes that investing in solar energy will pay off in the long run, with the system potentially paying for itself within 10 to 15 years. The company is also working on assembling solar panels in Nigeria to facilitate access to solar systems.

On average, solar power can aid Nigerians in conserving energy by optimizing the usage of appliances and lights. To address the intermittency of solar power generation, surplus electricity can be stored in batteries for later use.

Olamide emphasizes the importance of hybrid systems that can seamlessly switch to the public grid when solar power is insufficient. This setup allows users to store electricity in batteries for use during power outages.

Portable solar power solutions are also gaining traction, catering to electronic devices like mobile phones, PDAs, laptops, and car batteries. These portable solar chargers utilize sunlight to charge batteries and offer flexibility for users on the move.

Olamide aims to train a large number of Nigerians to install solar energy systems in millions of residential homes across the country. The training program is designed to be accessible to various professionals, including home builders, electricians, welders, roofers, and engineers, enabling them to transition effectively into the solar energy industry.

The company currently conducts three-day installation training sessions to equip individuals with the necessary skills for deploying solar energy systems.
