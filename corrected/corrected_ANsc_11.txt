Comparative Evaluation of EDTA, Pyridine, and Acetic Acid for the Assessment of Available Heavy Metals from Domestic and Industrial Sludges

Introduction
The escalating production of sludges resulting from the treatment of industrial and domestic wastewaters is posing a new environmental challenge due to their final disposal. Sludge is acknowledged as a valuable resource that can be repurposed as fertilizer and soil amendment due to its composition of organic compounds, macronutrients, micronutrients, nonessential trace elements, organic micropollutants, microorganisms, and eggs of parasitic organisms (Alloway and Jackson, 1991). The significant organic matter content and substantial nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations suggest its preferential use as a fertilizer in agriculture or a soil conditioner. However, concerns about potential environmental pollution risks, such as odor, water contamination, veterinary hazards, and heavy metal contamination, must be taken into account (Sterrit and Lester, 1980; Alloway and Jackson, 1991; Perez-Cid et al., 1996; Baveye et al., 1999). Determining total metal contents alone does not suffice to assess the potential environmental impact of metal-contaminated materials, as the chemical forms of metals in the sample matrix dictate their mobilization capacity, bioavailability, and ecotoxicity (Ure and Davidson, 1995; Gupta et al., 1996). Sequential extraction methods (Tessier et al., 1979; Quevauviller et al., 1993; McGrath, 1996; Olajire et al., 2003) and various leaching tests, especially batch single extractions (McGrath, 1996; Ure, 1996), are commonly used techniques to estimate metal mobility in soil and sediment samples. One remediation technique for metal-contaminated soils involves using chelating agents to form soluble metal-chelate complexes. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a widely used chelating agent due to its strong chelating ability for various heavy metals (Norvell, 1991; Peters and Shem, 1992; Kim and Ong, 1998; Kim and Ong, 2000). While EDTA and acetic acid single extractions have been primarily developed for soil and sludge analysis and extensively applied in this context (Ure, 1996; Tack and Verloo, 1996), there is limited literature on the comparative evaluation of EDTA, acetic acid, and pyridine extraction of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn) from sludge samples. It could be beneficial and insightful to employ this method to assess the potential mobility of heavy metals from sludge samples under complexing or acidification processes that occur in the environment, particularly when sludges are disposed of in landfills. This study aims to investigate the leaching of heavy metals (Pb, Hg, Cd, and Zn) from domestic and industrial sludges to evaluate their mobilizable content. Considering that the leaching behavior of sludge may vary based on the type of sludge sample, a secondary objective is to identify similarities and/or differences in EDTA, pyridine, and acetic acid leaching behavior of domestic and industrial sludges, categorized as highly organic matter-containing and typically inorganic sludges, respectively.

Materials and Methods
Sampling
Details of the sampling sites are provided in Table 1. Industrial sludge samples originated from wastewater treatment plants of industries in Ogba Industrial Estate, including Chemiron Pharmaceutical industry (site 4), Wamco Dairy Industry (site 5), and vegetable oil industries (site 6). Other industrial sludges were obtained from Apapa Industrial Estate, including Flour Mills (site 7), Flour Mill Fertilizer section (site 8), and from Ijora Industrial area, specifically Nitol Textile Industry (site 9). Domestic sludge samples were collected from wastewater sources in residential areas close to scrap metal dumping (site 2) and a local oil factory (site 3) in Sabo area of Ogbomoso. The samples were categorized as DS1 (site 1), DS2 (site 2), DS3 (site 3), IS1 (sites 4, 5, and 6), IS2 (sites 7 and 8), and IS3 (site 9), with DS representing domestic sludges and IS representing industrial sludges. All samples were collected in polyethylene containers, dried in the laboratory at 105Â°C, ground, sieved, and homogenized before storage for analysis.

Reagents
High-quality analytical reagent-grade reagents were used. Stock solutions of metals were prepared by dissolving appropriate salts in doubly distilled water. Nitric, hydrochloric, and hydrofluoric acids were used for sample digestion. Solutions of EDTA, acetic acid, and pyridine were prepared and stored in polyethylene bottles.

Single Extraction Procedure
EDTA, acetic acid, and pyridine single extractions were conducted on pretreated sludge samples. Extractions were carried out as described in Perez-Cid et al. (2002). Extracts were analyzed using standard addition technique.

Total and Pseudototal Digestions
Total metal content in sludges was determined through wet digestion. Pseudototal digestions were also performed. Results of total and pseudototal digestions for domestic and industrial sludges are summarized in Table 2.

Results
Analytical results of metal leaching from domestic and industrial sludges using EDTA, acetic acid, and pyridine extractions are presented in Table 3. Greater extraction efficiency was observed with EDTA, particularly for Pb and Hg in industrial sludges. Acetic acid extraction showed significant leaching of Pb and Zn in specific industrial samples. Pyridine extraction efficiency was notably low except for Zn and Hg in certain samples.

Discussion and Conclusion
Results of elemental analysis using total and pseudototal digestion methods indicated higher Hg and Cd levels in industrial sludges compared to domestic sludges. Industrial wastewater treatments led to lower heavy metal content in industrial sludges. Pseudototal digestion results were smaller than total digestions but still comparable for most elements. The extraction efficiencies of different digestion methods varied by element and sample type. Industrial sludges exhibited higher extraction efficiency for Zn and Cd. The study highlights the importance of understanding heavy metal mobility in sludge samples for effective environmental management.
