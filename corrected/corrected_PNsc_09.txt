The Arctic region holds one-third of the world's undiscovered gas reserves, with most of them located in Russian territory, according to an international team led by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). This marks the first comprehensive assessment of undiscovered oil and gas reserves within the Arctic Circle. The report detailing these findings will be published in an upcoming edition of the journal Science.

The report indicates that two-thirds of the undiscovered gas is concentrated in four main areas: the South Kara Sea, North Barents Basin, South Barents Basin, and the Alaska Platform. Particularly, the South Kara Sea off Siberia accounts for 39 percent of the Arctic's undiscovered gas. Furthermore, the Arctic is estimated to hold between three to four percent of the world's remaining undiscovered oil resources.

Lead author of the report, Donald L. Gautier, stated that while this discovery may not lead to a significant shift in the global oil balance, it holds particular importance for the Arctic nations. These nations include Canada, Greenland/Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States (with Greenland considered part of the Kingdom of Denmark).

Through geological analysis and probability modeling, researchers have assessed sedimentary rock deposits to estimate the volume of undiscovered oil and gas beneath undersea continental shelves. While deep ocean basins have limited petroleum potential, the Arctic stands out as one of the largest accessible regions for oil and gas exploration. Most of these reserves are projected to be found in waters less than 500 meters deep.

Gautier, based at the USGS office in Menlo Park, California, estimates that there are between 40 billion to 160 billion barrels of oil north of the Arctic Circle. This is a revision from the USGS's previous estimate of 90 billion barrels of oil in the region. The Energy Information Administration projects that the world currently consumes 30 billion barrels of oil per year.

Additionally, the US Geological Survey reported that Nigeria's total discovered and undiscovered gas reserves could amount to 600 trillion standard cubic feet (tscf), while the current estimate for Nigeria's gas reserves stands at 187 tscf.
