DETERMINANTS OF FOOD CHOICES AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN SOUTH-WESTERN NIGERIA

ABSTRACT
The food choices of adolescents in South-Western Nigeria have been increasingly unhealthy, putting them at a higher risk of malnutrition as they age. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing adolescents' food choices to evaluate their nutritional knowledge and implications. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescents as children aged 10-19 years. Four hundred and one adolescents from secondary schools in six out of thirty local government areas in Osun State, Nigeria, participated in the study. Thirty-two schools were selected based on the population of secondary schools in the local government areas. Structured questionnaires with high-quality color photographs of various foods and drinks commonly offered to adolescents were used. The study employed descriptive statistical techniques such as frequency counts, percentage, mean, and standard deviation, along with inferential tools like correlation analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for data analysis. The results indicated a positive and significant correlation between food and drink preferences and their nutritional content. Adolescents' food choices were more influenced by taste preferences than nutritional value. The study also revealed a high level of nutritional knowledge among adolescents but a lack of awareness regarding homemade non-alcoholic drinks. It is recommended to enhance nutrition education, especially focusing on traditional foods and nutritious homemade beverages.

INTRODUCTION
The nutritional quality of diets among adolescent school children in Nigeria has been a longstanding concern. Despite several studies on adolescents' food habits and preferences, there remains a challenge in guiding them towards nutritionally balanced meals. Previous research has shown a preference for snack foods and sugary drinks among adolescents, with taste and appearance outweighing nutritional value in food choices. Efforts to improve adolescents' eating habits through school-based initiatives are crucial, considering their strong influence on food preferences. Understanding adolescents' beliefs about food is essential for effective interventions. Contrary to expectations, studies have shown that preferred meals are not necessarily less healthy than perceived healthier options. This study aims to explore the factors driving adolescents' food and drink choices, their nutritional knowledge, and attitudes toward food and health.

METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents aged 10-19 years in both urban and rural areas of Osun State, Nigeria, using a multistage stratified random sampling technique. Data were collected through structured questionnaires administered to 401 adolescents from various schools. The questionnaire included high-quality color photographs of foods and drinks commonly consumed by adolescents for meal selection tasks. Adolescents were asked to select their preferred meals and rate their healthiness on a five-point scale. Data analysis included frequency counts, correlation analysis, ANOVA, and comparison between urban and rural respondents.

RESULTS
The most frequently chosen food items among adolescents were rice, fresh fruits, bread, pounded yam, and bean dishes, while the least popular choices included boiled yam, bean balls, and cassava products. Fruit juice, milk, water, and soft drinks were the preferred beverages, with chocolate drinks and homemade non-alcoholic drinks like 'kunu' and 'sobo' being less favored. Stewed beans, rice, fruits, and bread were perceived as healthy food choices, while fruit juice, milk, and water were considered healthy drinks. Adolescents showed a preference for soft and sweetened drinks despite being aware of their unhealthiness due to their affordability and availability.

CONCLUSION
Adolescents in South-Western Nigeria tend to prioritize taste preferences over nutritional content in their food choices. While they demonstrate good nutritional knowledge, there is a need to increase awareness about the health benefits of traditional foods and homemade non-alcoholic drinks. This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing adolescents' food choices and highlights the importance of promoting nutritious dietary habits among this demographic.
