Between Museums and the Public

Until very recently, the contents of museums were primarily information-based, focusing on dates, places, and facts as the standard. However, curators have begun to experiment with new ways of presenting collections in hopes of effectively engaging their target audience.

John Cotton Dana, the Director of Network Museums, emphasized that the utilization of museum displays is more crucial than the items themselves. He implemented various practices to enhance the museum's utility, such as lending objects to school classrooms, shops, and hospitals, establishing teacher-training courses at local colleges, opening a children-only junior museum, and setting up branch museums in local libraries.

In the past, Nigerian museums passively awaited public visits. These visits were typically guided by museum education officers who led visitors around the galleries, resulting in a lack of effective object interpretation and limited opportunities for public engagement in museum affairs.

In Nigeria, museums are no longer seen as sacred or untouchable; rather, they are open to scrutiny by a discerning public. Rethinking the role of museums has prompted a thorough examination of values, assumptions, and the types of services provided.

At the core of this new approach is the museum professionals' desire to make museums relevant and beneficial to society, particularly in terms of education and promotion. Consequently, some Nigerian museums, notably the Lagos Museum, have begun forming partnerships with educational institutions, both public and private schools, colleges, universities, and art organizations.

In Nigeria, a significant portion of museum visitors comprises schoolchildren and university students. Therefore, programs are designed to stimulate intellectual and cultural ideas among children and adults, reshaping museum activities like object interpretation, ethnic biases, and self-identification.

Modern museums involve the public in all aspects of their operations. While exhibitions were traditionally planned and executed by museum professionals, recent collaborations with corporate entities, NGOs, and the general public have contributed to the success of museum exhibitions.

For example, the Lagos Museum collaborated with the Ford Foundation on a temporary exhibition titled "All is not lost."

The public's involvement in museum affairs has greatly improved museum practices, especially in the selection of objects for display. Nigeria, being a culturally diverse nation, boasts one of the world's richest collections of objects. These objects often showcase cultural similarities among the Nigerian people, reflecting a sense of unity.

Theodore Low aptly noted that museums play a crucial role in shaping ideologies, emphasizing the importance of truth, social cohesion, and mental well-being. Museums have the potential to influence millions of citizens and, therefore, must acknowledge their responsibility in society.

In conclusion, with museums now inviting public collaboration, the onus is on the public to rise to the challenge and ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are met.
