Introduction
In Nigeria, efforts have been made over the years to ensure that consumers have access to information on products they consume. As a result, agencies like the Consumer Protection Council (CPC), Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON), and others were established to ensure that standards are maintained in relation to products (CPC, 2004; SON, 2004).
In 1999, the government of Nigeria under Obasanjo intensified this campaign by establishing the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) as a parastatal under the Federal Ministry of Health. The aim was to ensure that standards are maintained, particularly among Nigerian consumers. The establishment of cottage industries in Nigeria is a result of economic hardship in the country and the need to survive. In this regard, several bakeries, packaged water companies, and other industries that have recently emerged must be monitored, especially in the interest of consumers. Monitoring these industries involves communicating information about products to consumers through the media and other available means. Currently, one of these means is through NAFDAC labels (in the form of numbers and information statements) on all NAFDAC-certified products. Some manufacturers have also been directed to label their products, informing consumers that certain conditions have been met. For example, water packaged in sachets is labeled with NAFDAC numbers as a source of information for the public. Similarly, bakers in Nigeria have been instructed to label bread as "Bromate free". These serve as avenues to inform the public that products with NAFDAC certification have met the required standards (NAFDAC, 2000).

Statement of the Problem
Organizations responsible for information dissemination and standard maintenance argue that their aims and objectives can be effectively achieved through public sensitization and awareness programs, either on the product itself or through other means like print and electronic media (CPC, 2004; SON, 2004). According to them, this will ensure that consumers consider a product’s warning and information labels with the necessary seriousness before consumption. Given the developments of labels in the last 30 years, it is crucial to determine whether consumers pay attention to product labels before purchasing and consuming selected products for this study.
Studies have revealed that the consumption of certain food products can be harmful to one’s health. For example, impure water can cause illnesses such as typhoid fever (Shenge and Babalola, 2003), and the addition of potassium bromate to bread can lead to various health issues (Kurokwa, 1982; NAFDAC, 1993). Likewise, the impact of tobacco consumption on smokers, due to smoking and unhygienic eating habits, is significant (Akinola, 2004; Idowu, 2004).
Regulatory bodies take daily steps to ensure proper consumer sensitization (NAFDAC, 2002; SON, 2004). However, empirical evidence suggests that not enough is being done to sensitize consumers from the perspective of information dissemination (Okeibunor, 1999; Olaniyi, 2002; Akinrimisa, 2003; Adekunle, 2004). Reports indicate an increase in diseases and infections resulting from what people consume. Considerable amounts of money are spent annually on advertisements, billboards, and public awareness efforts. Both private and government organizations invest substantial sums to educate the public. Therefore, it is essential to examine the level of knowledge and awareness of warning and information labels and the factors influencing consumers' observance or nonobservance of product labels, with the aim of understanding the relationship among these variables. This is necessary given the growing consumer consciousness regarding their consumption habits (Miller and Ginter, 1985).

Following the discussion above, the following research questions are pertinent for the study:

Research Questions
1. What do consumers know about information labels?
2. Do consumers observe products’ warnings and information labels before making purchases?
3. Are the target consumers aware of the intentions and objectives of the product warning and information labels on products?
4. What factors can affect consumers’ knowledge and observance of information labels on products?

Objectives of the Study
The study aims to:
1. Determine if consumers pay attention to product warnings and information labels before making purchases.
2. Evaluate whether consumers are aware of the intentions and objectives of product warning and information labels.
3. Identify factors that may influence consumers’ knowledge of information labels on selected products.

Brief Literature Review
Everyone is a consumer to some extent, using goods and resources of our economy (Parkinson and Michael, 1994). For research purposes, the concept of consumer needs to be expanded beyond private industry to encompass the consumption of services from educational institutions, government organizations, and non-profit organizations. The public includes users of services from various entities like police, mail carriers, ministers, among others (Parkinson and Michael, 1994).
Various terms have been used to describe labels on products, such as eco-labels or branding. Green (1998) discusses the environmental impact of British detergent industries and advocates for stricter eco-labeling to reduce pollution. Mattoo and Singh (1994) use eco-labeling to provide consumers with information about products. Other scholars use branding to describe product labeling. Aldersey (1998) examines pharmaceutical companies' branding to justify product pricing.
When consumers interpret information on labels, factors like knowledge and attitude play a role. Aaker and Keller (1990) suggest that consumers' ability to interpret logos influences their understanding of product information. The knowledge of labels affects consumers' overall attitudes and understanding of products. Lack of accurate product knowledge can hinder positive attitudes toward products. Manufacturers use labels to distinguish their products and attract buyers. Policy makers support product labeling to protect consumer health. Labels can influence market demand for environmentally friendly products. Consumers often consider price when purchasing goods, but status can also influence purchasing decisions.
Theoretical Framework
The study is guided by Symbolic Interactionism, which focuses on social actions based on the meanings individuals assign to symbols, objects, or events in their social context. Symbols shape how people interact with their environment and each other, with shared symbols facilitating effective communication. Role-taking and shared symbols are essential for meaningful human interaction. Symbolic Interactionism emphasizes the importance of common symbols for effective communication and understanding in society.
