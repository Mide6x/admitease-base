Visafone Launches Call Hunting Service

Visafone announced over the weekend that it has launched the Visafone Call Hunting Service as part of its efforts to enhance the quality of customer care services for its clients.

The call hunting service, as described by the company, is tailored for businesses looking to enhance their customer care experience for clients. It is primarily geared towards corporate organizations, small and medium-sized enterprises, non-governmental non-profit organizations, among others.

This product works by linking up to ten numbers to a call group with one pilot number serving as the umbrella number for advertising. This serves as a more efficient alternative to the multiple numbers typically shared on business cards, flyers, posters, television ads, and radio jingles.

In explaining the product, Visafone officials emphasized that when a call is placed, it is automatically directed to an available line within the group. This saves the customer time from trying multiple numbers and prevents them from forming a negative impression of the companyâ€™s customer service if they face difficulties reaching the intended party or if calls are missed. This system also portrays the organization as highly efficient.

With the pilot number potentially falling under the special (gold) number category, the product arranges calls in a linear order by connecting them in a specific sequence. If a number is busy, the call is automatically redirected to the next available number in the group.

Another option, the circular order, directs calls to numbers that have not previously received calls until all numbers in the group have been connected. This method establishes a call circle where every phone in the group receives a call, not just the first available ones. The pilot number may be easy to remember, making it simple for clients and customers to retain access to the organization's numbers.

Visafone further clarified that the call hunting service aims to provide small, growing, and large organizations with a well-managed call and customer service unit, enabling them to cater to multiple customers simultaneously while eliminating the possibility of failed or missed calls.
