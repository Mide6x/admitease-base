Innoson, Bajaj, Audi, BMW, and other top automotive brands compete for the Auto of the Year Awards.

One of the challenges faced by the organizers of the Nigerian Auto Media Awards is determining which brand will receive the Motorcycle of the Year award and which car will be honored with the prestigious Premium Luxury Car of the Year award.

A source close to the organizing committee confirmed that a crucial meeting was held last week to deliberate on the two categories. The Nation learned that three brands have been nominated for each category: Bajaj, Hajuoe Suzuki, and Innoson for motorcycles; and Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, and Mercedes Benz S-Class for premium luxury cars.

These cars stand out in terms of luxury, product quality, and exceptional performance. Their dealerships – Audi Centre (Stallion Motors) for Audi, Coscharis Motors for BMW, and Westar Associates/Globe Motors for Mercedes-Benz – have contributed significantly to their positive brand image.

These automobiles are considered among the most advanced in the world, leading experts to frequently compare their innovative technologies. The intelligence systems, such as COMMAND in Benz and iDrive in the 7 Series, are often subject to analytical comparisons.

Mr. Frank Okechukwu, the Chief Executive Officer of Goldcrest Communication, expressed confidence that the organizers will be fair in selecting the winners of the various categories. Goldcrest Communication is partnering with the Guild of Motoring Correspondents to organize the awards and lecture.

Okechukwu acknowledged the impressive pedigree of all the nominees for the Motorcycle of the Year award. He noted that the competition for this award is tight and difficult to predict.

Suzuki, with a long history in the Nigerian motorcycle market, Bajaj, an Indian brand gaining popularity locally, and Innoson Nigeria Limited from Nnewi are all strong contenders. Innoson, known for reducing the prices of new motorcycles in the country by establishing its own plant in Nnewi, has made tokunbo motorcycles less attractive with its competitive pricing.

Innoson is also notable for being the only motorcycle marketer producing crash helmets in Nigeria, using a combination of imported and locally sourced materials.
