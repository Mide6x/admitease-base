Windows 7: Revolutionizing Computer Usage

The introduction of Windows 7 by the world's leading software producer, Microsoft Corporation, is set to herald a revolution in computer usage. CHUKS UDO OKONTA examines its features and users' expectations.

The launch of the long-awaited Windows 7 last week by Microsoft Corporation signifies another milestone in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. This new version of Windows, which replaces Vista, is designed to align with current trends in the communications sector and enhance human productivity.

According to a recent survey, the computer is considered one of the best human inventions. To maintain this position, Microsoft Corporation continues to research and develop devices that will assist and enhance human existence.

Windows 7, with the catchphrase 'Your PC simplified,' enables users to instantly locate and open almost any file on their computers - from documents to emails and songs, directly from the start menu by simply typing a word or two in the Windows search. 

It also allows users to open files and navigate their computers quickly with the improved taskbar, which allows pinning frequently used programs for easy access. Files used regularly are opened without hassle using jump lists. Managing multiple open programs, documents, and browser windows is made easy with thumbnail and full-screen previews. Users can resize and organize open windows, arranging two windows side by side by dragging them to opposite sides of the screen, and more.

At the launch of Windows in Lagos, Country Manager of Microsoft Nigeria, Mr. Emmanuel Onyeje, stated that with Windows 7, Microsoft has elevated the level of computer improvement. He emphasized that the feedback from one billion Windows users worldwide has guided Microsoft in developing Windows 7 to meet users' needs effectively.

Mr. Onyeje highlighted that Windows 7 caters to various user needs with different versions tailored for different purposes. From Windows 7 Starter and Home Basic for first-time PC buyers to Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate for enterprise customers and high-end computer users, Microsoft offers a wide range of options.

Windows 7 is available in 33 languages, including English, French, and Portuguese, with plans to expand to African languages like Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba within 18 to 24 months. The Windows will be available in all Microsoft-certified outlets in Nigeria from mid-November.

Microsoft's Nigeria Technology Manager, Mr. Oluwale Olukodano, emphasized that Windows 7 prioritizes productivity, security, and enterprise needs, ensuring data security within the system. The Internet Explorer 8 in Windows 7 enhances web browsing speed, safety, and privacy protection.

Industry professionals such as Chief Information Officer of First City Monument Bank, Mr. Olayinka Oni, and Chief Operating Officer of Signal Alliance, Mr. Adanma Onuegbu, praised Windows 7 for its speed, ease of use, and efficiency, recommending it to their organizations and customers.

Before purchasing and installing Windows 7, consider the hardware and software requirements. If your current PC runs Windows Vista, it can handle Windows 7 without issues. For Windows XP users, ensure your hardware meets the minimum specifications for Windows 7 to run smoothly.

The prices for Windows 7 range from £59.00 to £159.99, offering various editions to cater to different user needs and preferences.
