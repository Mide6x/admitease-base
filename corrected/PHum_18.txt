Mantras of a Kind
Undoubtedly, this is a period of poetry harvest in Nigeria. Across the literary landscape of the country, there is a proliferation of poetry collections by both seasoned and young authors. This raises the question: do these works meet the criteria for good poetry? Some poets have successfully addressed the myriad of challenges facing the nation, shedding light on the deep-rooted issues plaguing Nigeria.

Ayeba Biobazagha is one such poet. In his latest collection, "Mantras for Wagibote," he delves into various national concerns. His verses are contemplative and poignant, offering profound reflections on themes such as repentance, pilgrimage, songs of sorrow, and the societal malaise in Nigeria. These poems encapsulate the essence of human existence, relationships, emotions, and the need for societal introspection and transformation.

In "Songs of Sorrow," the poet laments, "You brought me the first insight/ On the perception of death/To know the belabors of sorrow/That strangles the insomniac mind/Always recasting model memories/That marshal in a chronicle of tears..." The themes of love, sorrow, and regret reverberate throughout the collection, particularly in the poignant portrayal of Wangibote, an Ogbanje â€“ a child destined to die. The poet's profound grief and contemplation on life and death are palpable, yet the focus remains singularly on Wangibote.

The collection predominantly explores lost love and the poet's reflections on life's journey. While the imagery may not always convey the depths of sorrow and regret effectively, the poet skillfully captures the essence of unrequited love and longing. In "Eve," the poet expresses, "I love the way you are shaped/Like a pear fruit curved/Two legs to carry your poise/Two hands to hold me close/A head to place on my shoulder/You want me ever needing you/You are a thermostat/For manifesting emotions..."

In "Mantras of the Delta," the poet delves into the ramifications of amnesty, uneven development in the region, and the culpability of those perpetuating unrest. The poem underscores that until the human suffering in the Delta is addressed, issues like kidnapping, conflict, unemployment, and environmental degradation will persist, complicating Nigeria's history. Pollution and discord now overshadow love and harmony in the Delta region.

The imagery in the collection vividly depicts a society grappling with corruption and power struggles. The poet warns against the consequences of leadership failure, emphasizing the need for responsible governance and resource utilization to benefit the populace.

In essence, Nigeria symbolizes Wagibote, the fated entity born to perish. The nation's entrenched problems may morph and resurface in different guises, reinforcing the imperative for meaningful change and progress.
