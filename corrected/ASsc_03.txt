ABSTRACT
This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and utilization of rice agrochemicals, as well as the understanding and use of safety precautions and techniques related to the proper application of these chemicals among rice farmers in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area (LGA) of Ogun State, Nigeria. A multi-stage random sampling technique was utilized to select respondents for the study. A total of 127 functioning rice farmers were randomly selected from the list of registered farmers in the area. Data was collected through validated structured interview schedules. The study revealed that a majority of farmers were under 50 years old, married, and literate to some extent. Most farmers were small-scale rice producers with limited contact with agricultural extension agents. While the knowledge and use of agrochemicals were moderately high, the awareness and actual use of safety devices and methods were low. Significant relationships were found between age, educational level, and knowledge of safety measures related to rice agrochemical application. The study recommends improving farmers' literacy levels and intensifying education campaigns by extension agents on the safe use of rice agrochemicals.

INTRODUCTION
Rice has transitioned from a ceremonial or weekend food to a staple in the daily diet of households in Nigeria. The use of agrochemicals in farming practices has evolved over time, contributing to increased crop yield. However, concerns about the health risks associated with long-term exposure to agrochemicals have grown. Agricultural workers face higher risks of fatalities and injuries due to agrochemical exposure. Rice farmers, in particular, are exposed to agrochemicals during cultivation and storage processes, leading to potential health hazards. Public awareness of agrochemical use is increasing, emphasizing the need for proper education, training, and safety measures among farmers to mitigate risks effectively.

METHODOLOGY
This study was conducted among rice farmers in Obafemi-Owode LGA, Ogun State, Nigeria. A sample of 127 functioning rice farmers was randomly selected from a list of registered farmers. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed on the collected data to evaluate the socio-economic characteristics, knowledge, and use of agrochemicals among the respondents.

RESULTS
The study revealed that the majority of respondents were male, married, and below 50 years old. While most farmers were engaged in farming as their primary occupation, some also participated in non-farm income-generating activities. Cooperative societies were a common formal social group among the respondents. The level of education varied, with a significant proportion having only primary education. Knowledge and use of agrochemicals were moderately high, with agricultural extension agents being a primary source of information for farmers. However, awareness and utilization of safety devices were low among the respondents.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
The findings suggest that age, education level, and engagement in non-farm activities influence farmers' knowledge and adoption of safety measures related to agrochemical use. Cooperative societies play a crucial role in supporting farmers with loans and market access. Enhancing farmers' literacy levels and increasing the frequency of extension agent visits are essential to promote safe agrochemical practices among rice farmers.
