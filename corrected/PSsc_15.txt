Taming the Menace of Child Abuse

Recently, Akwa Ibom State gained international attention due to cases of child abuse where some innocent children were falsely accused of being witches, mistreated, and abandoned on the streets. In response to this growing issue, the state government enacted laws against child abuse, and the governor took further steps to rehabilitate these children, receiving widespread commendation. This was reported by MARY EKAH.

Governor Godswill Akpabio's surprise visit to the abandoned children who were labeled as witches in Eket, Akwa Ibom State, has garnered international praise, with many Akwa Ibom natives living abroad commending him as a compassionate and empathetic leader who has positively impacted the lives of the people. Even the governor's harshest critics expressed admiration for him in online forums hosted by Yahoo groups. Last week, Akpabio visited the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network (CRARN), where Mr. Samuel Itauma and his wife care for over 200 children rejected by their families.

During the visit, which surprised even the Itauma family, Akpabio announced a donation of N10 million and the establishment of a scholarship program to support the children's tertiary education even after his tenure ends. He also formed a committee to reunite some of the children with their families and guardians, ensuring their protection from further abuse and harassment.

He emphasized the need for ongoing education, enlightenment, and advocacy to combat child stigmatization. He suggested a collaborative effort involving the state, the UK, and the US to change societal perceptions. He urged the Attorney General to go beyond traditional legal approaches and utilize state powers effectively to address this issue, emphasizing that government collaboration with private entities and service providers is essential, with the best interests of the children guiding all actions.

The issue of child witchcraft gained significant media attention following the documentary "Saving Africa's Witch Children," which received prestigious awards such as BAFTA and Amnesty Film awards. The documentary exposed Helen Ukpabio's role in promoting the belief in child 'witches' in Southeastern Nigeria. Helen Ukpabio's teachings, as outlined in her book "Unveiling the Mysteries of Witchcraft," have sparked international outrage and condemnation due to statements like "a child under two years old who cries at night and experiences health deterioration is a Satan's agent."
