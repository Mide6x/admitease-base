LG Launches Dual SIM/Touch Screen Phone
LG Electronics has introduced a new dual SIM card and touch screen handset model, the 'LG-KS660,' into the telecom market.
In a statement released by the company, it was mentioned that the product's slim design and user-friendly tools will aid users in better time management and increased efficiency.
Mr. Steve Koh, the General Manager of Mobile Communicators at LG Electronics, West Africa Operation, stated, "Mobile handsets have become an essential part of everyday life for both private consumers and businesses. This has facilitated easier communication outside the office. It is with this in mind that LG developed the LG-KS660 with dual SIM capabilities to offer a more practical and intelligent touch screen solution for business professionals."
The inclusion of a feature called 'LG-Bi-SIM' in this new LG handset allows users to utilize two SIM cards and multiple call-waiting functions simultaneously. With both cards in place and call-waiting functions active, users can handle up to four calls at once.
The user-friendly touch screen interface enables seamless switching between callers on hold and the active call without the need to switch cards or power off the device.
Moreover, by using the phone stylus, users can handwrite messages while on calls and send them as images instantly. The automatic handwriting recognition feature ensures a swift response to user input from the LG-KS660.
