Inadequate Infrastructure Threatens Digital Television Broadcast
The nation's Vision 2012 for digital television broadcast is under threat due to insufficient infrastructure. Stakeholders argue that the success of the concept relies on the government providing the necessary framework and infrastructure. CHUKS UDO OKONTA reports.
Will the digitization of television broadcast be achievable by June 17, 2012? This is a crucial question on the minds of stakeholders, who are concerned about the state of the infrastructure required for the implementation of this concept.
Industry experts believe that the concept can only be successful if challenges such as poor power supply, insufficient bandwidth, inconsistent government policies, lack of skilled personnel, and other obstacles are effectively addressed.
In 2007, Nigeria aligned with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) resolution to phase out analog television broadcast by 2015. To realize this concept, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua endorsed the nation's Vision 2012 digitization policy in December 2007. However, The Nation's investigation revealed that since the endorsement, the white paper for the implementation of the policy has not been released by the government.
A source at the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) informed The Nation that the commission is awaiting the implementation of the contents of the white paper.
Digital television is a modern method of transmitting high-quality video and audio signals to viewers' television sets. This platform enables operators to transmit high-definition television images, compact disc quality surround audio, and new services such as multicasting, which involves having more than one program on the same channel; as well as data casting, which includes electronic program guides and interactive television.
This technology allows a minimum of four programs and channels to be transmitted simultaneously from a station using the same bandwidth originally used for a single program or channel on an analog transmission platform. It offers a variety of services such as multimedia, banking, home shopping, and faster rates of data transmission.
The Head of Public Affairs at the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), Mr. Awwalu Salihu, stated in an interview with The Nation that operators on paid television have fully embraced the digital platform, and those on the analog platform are 70% compliant.
He mentioned that the concept would revolutionize television broadcast, rendering most current television sets obsolete. Viewers would need to purchase compliant televisions.
Salihu emphasized, "Currently, all paid television providers are transmitting on the digital platform; we are in the final stage of transitioning the operations of those on the analog platform to full digitization. Those on the analog platform are 70%, and we aim to progress them to the next level in a meticulous manner to avoid creating issues for the operators."
Dr. Ronke Ogunmakin, the Director of Media and Information at the National Open University of Nigeria and former officer at the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), highlighted the importance of infrastructure in sustaining technological advancements.
She emphasized the need for adequate infrastructure to support technology-driven individuals, stating that without proper infrastructure, technological advancements would not yield significant results. Ogunmakin noted that Nigerians, particularly the youth, are eager to embrace information and communications technology but are hindered by the lack of necessary infrastructure.
She urged the government to prioritize the development of infrastructure, especially in the power sector, as it is essential for the effective functioning of various sectors of the economy. Ogunmakin stressed the importance of adopting measures similar to those employed in developed nations to address Nigeria's infrastructure challenges.
Regarding television content, Ogunmakin expressed dissatisfaction with the current offerings by operators and emphasized the need for improved local content production. She suggested that operators enhance their sound, picture quality, and programs to meet the standards set by the NBC, ensuring relevance in modern technology.
Consumers were encouraged to demand quality services from providers to drive improvements in the television industry. Ogunmakin emphasized the importance of consumer feedback in shaping the quality of services delivered and stressed the collaborative effort needed between regulators and consumers to enhance television services.
