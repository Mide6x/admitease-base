CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background To The Study
The Ekid language is one of the languages of the Lower Cross. Although the Ekid language has been in existence for centuries, only limited linguistic description has been conducted. There is a lack of published lexicographical work on the language, raising concerns about its preservation and continuity.
Lexicography, a branch of Applied Linguistics, focuses on selecting lexical items for dictionary making and compiling a lexicon (Crystal, 1985: 179). The creation of an Ekid-English dictionary is crucial for documenting the Ekid language for future generations and meeting the communicative needs of Ekid speakers in their daily lives.
This study aims to meticulously choose entries for the dictionary and provide detailed information for each entry. Common vocabulary and loan words adapted for everyday use are included. To cater to the specific needs of language researchers and enthusiasts, phonological and grammatical information is incorporated for each entry. Additionally, pictures accompany some entries in the Ekid-English dictionary for enhanced information and documentation purposes.
1.2 Statement Of The Problem
A dictionary serves as a reference book containing words of a language, alphabetically arranged with details on their forms, pronunciations, functions, meanings, and idiomatic uses (Kipfer, 1984: 2). The process of dictionary creation, known as lexicography, is influenced by factors such as size coverage, time constraints, and orthographical considerations. Developing an Ekid-English dictionary relies heavily on the availability of an Ekid database, along with the necessary hardware and software tools. This study endeavors to produce a bilingual Ekid-English dictionary as part of a language documentation project, presenting information in Ekid with English translations.
1.3 History Of Ekid People
According to Udo (1983: 72), the Ekid people reside in the southern part of Akwa Ibom State, situated northeast of Ibuno. They are separated from the Atlantic Ocean by swamplands, with their community stretching from the southern coast to Ikot Ubo in Ubium Clan, covering approximately fifteen kilometers. Eket town, headquarters of Eket Local Government, lies by the Kwa Iboe River.
The early European accounts describe the Ekid people as "Warlike Ibibio," "very wild Ibibio," and truculent savages who showed resilience against British Officers. The British made multiple expeditions to establish order among the Ekid people. The Ekid people, among the earliest Central Ibibio immigrants, migrated southwards to their current location due to pressure from new arrivals. Some groups settled in Ibuno briefly before returning to the mainland due to unsuitable conditions.
"Eket" is the European term for "Ekid," which embodies the people's identity, language, and region. The Ekid people are believed to have settled in Nigeria before 1,500 B.C., reaching the Atlantic Ocean by 1000 A.D. They are considered among the early immigrants of the Suddanic or Semi-Bantu people.
1.4 Ekid Language: Classification, Speakers, And Historical Development
Ekid is the name of both a language and its speakers, predominantly spoken in Eket Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State by approximately two hundred thousand individuals (Connell, 1991: 8). It shares linguistic connections with Ibibio, Efik, Anaang, Oro, and Ibuno languages, with distinct dialectal variances from Ibibio and other Lower Cross languages. While Ekid speakers understand and speak Ibibio fluently without formal learning, the reverse is not true.
1.4.1 Classification
Williamson (1989) categorizes Ekid within the Lower Cross Subgroup family of the Delta group in the Cross River Sub-branch of the New Benue-Congo branch of the Niger-Congo sub-family. The Lower Cross language group derives its name from its geographical location in the lower Cross River basin of Southeastern Nigeria, extending across Rivers, Akwa Ibom, and Cross River States, and Isangele sub-division of South-Western Cameroon. Ekid is placed within the Lower Cross group of the Cross River Sub-branch of Proto Benue-Congo under the Niger-Congo phylum in more recent classifications (Williamson and Blench, 2000).
1.4.2 Historical Development Of Ekid
The roots of the Ekid language trace back centuries, with minimal scholarly works available on the language by various authors. The preservation and documentation of Ekid language remain essential in the face of potential extinction, motivating the need for this study.
1.5 Purpose Of The Study
The absence of a comprehensive lexicographical publication on Ekid language necessitates efforts to document and preserve it for future generations. This study aims to compile a bilingual Ekid-English dictionary from a database, catering to the Ekid community's linguistic needs and facilitating effective translation between Ekid and English.
1.6 Scope Of The Study
This study centers on collecting around one thousand vocabulary items related to Ekid language and culture, utilizing Perl scripting methodology for database storage and dictionary production. The bilingual dictionary entries include headwords, transcriptions, word classes, etymology, meaning equivalents, and select visuals for non-universal headwords. Due to constraints in time, resources, and materials, elements like illustrative sentences, idioms, and proverbs are excluded.
1.7 Significance Of The Study
This study fulfills post-graduate requirements and contributes to the preservation of Ekid language from potential extinction. By establishing an Ekid database and converting it into a bilingual dictionary, the study aims to support linguistic research, promote Ekid language writing systems, and stimulate interest in its study among researchers, students, teachers, and the Ekid-speaking community.
1.8 Methodology
The study focuses on creating an Ekid-English bilingual dictionary, necessitating a dictionary-making application employing Perl scripting methodology. The research methodology involves:
1.8.1 Data Collection
Approximately one thousand words were gathered from Ekid speakers to construct the database. Data collection involved structured wordlists like the Ibadan 400 Wordlist and SIL Comparative African Wordlist, eliciting vocabulary related to local flora, fauna, body parts, kinship terms, numerals, colors, verbs, adjectives, and daily activities. Additional data were obtained from events like marriage and burial ceremonies, natural interactions within the Ekid community, and recorded using video and audio cameras. A corpus was built from these data and phonetically transcribed into written materials. Visual data were captured using a digital camera, and reference materials like dictionaries, textbooks, websites, and publications were consulted.
1.8.2 Data Analysis
Collected data underwent detailed analysis, focusing on Ekid phonemic consonants and vowels through classical phonemic principles, minimal pairs, and free variation to distinguish phonemes from allophones.
Minimal pairs are words differing in meaning by one sound, illustrating phonemic distinctions. Free variation refers to sounds that occur interchangeably without changing word meanings. Ekid vowels and consonants were analyzed through examples of minimal pairs and free variation to determine phonemic status.
1.8.3 Data Processing
Data were structured into a table with headwords, transcriptions, word classes, etymology, and meaning equivalents, then alphabetized using word processing applications on a laptop. IPA characters and diacritics were incorporated using the Charis SIL font for phonetic symbols.
1.8.4 Data/Information Export
After data processing, the table was exported to Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format for Perl scripting, enabling the conversion to a properly formatted document.
