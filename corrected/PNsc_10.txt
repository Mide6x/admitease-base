Promote Tree Planting Culture - Ikuforiji

The Right Honourable Adeyemi Ikuforiji, Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, has urged residents of Lagos to embrace the practice of planting trees to protect the environment. Ikuforiji made this call during the 2009 tree planting campaign held at Oba Ogunji Road in Agege, where he led a team representing the state governor, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, in planting trees along the road. Speaking to reporters after planting a tree, the speaker encouraged residents to ensure the state government's vision for a green environment is maintained.

"It should not be a one-time event but something we do daily. We must safeguard our environment as we witness the current changes. Look at the amount of rainfall we've experienced this year. It has exceeded the usual levels. Global warming is a reality, and it is crucial to protect our environment. If everyone adopts this mindset, there will be no need for special caretakers as the community will embrace this practice," he emphasized.

In his welcome speech, the speaker reiterated the state government's dedication to "restoring as much greenery as possible" to ensure a safe and healthy environment. Underscoring the significance of trees, he noted their scientific role in combating global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.

Ikuforiji disclosed that the state meticulously monitors trees planted during previous campaigns in Ikeja, Apapa, and Ikoyi, with a total count of 3,088 in these areas. He urged residents to actively participate in tree preservation efforts and integrate tree planting as a cultural norm.

During the event, Dr. Mrs. Titi Anibaba, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment representing Commissioner of Environment, Dr. Muiz Baniz, emphasized the religious significance attached to tree planting across various faiths. Anibaba cited passages from the Holy Quran, the Holy Bible, and traditional beliefs that advocate for tree planting and environmental conservation.

Dr. Saka Jimoh from the University of Ibadan (UI), representing Professor Musiliu Onilude from the Department of Agricultural Engineering, stressed that tree planting should not solely rely on government initiatives. Jimoh demonstrated the proper tree planting techniques to participants and introduced two species for planting - the Terminalia Montalis suitable for open fields and house fronts, and the Queens Palm recommended for road medians due to its shallow roots that do not disrupt underground cables.

Mrs. Kemi Nelson, an Action Congress (AC) Leader in the state, encouraged campaign participants to cherish and nurture the trees they plant, expressing the importance of showing care and dedication to environmental preservation.
