How to Be Your Own Boss and Be Successful

Following my recent article in the Business class on focusing on your goals, I received an overwhelming response: 500 thank you calls, 50 commendations, 700 emails, 250 text messages, 17 consultation requests, 3 book publishing offers, and 12 invitations to speak at youth and business seminars and conferences. I was deeply touched and considered reaching out to everyone to express my gratitude. One can hardly imagine the impact a single good article can have.

Among the numerous messages, I noticed that 40% of them expressed challenges and fears regarding starting their own business and becoming their own boss. Hence, I decided to address this topic in this week's piece. While being your own boss is one thing, being successful at it is another. You may start your own venture but not excel, in which case you might have been better off as an employee. Drawing from my personal experiences, research, and insights from top Nigerian and international CEOs, I present to you the fundamentals of becoming a successful boss.

**Generate Numerous Ideas:** The initial step is to brainstorm ideas extensively. Engage in activities like reading science fiction, exploring futurism, watching TED talks, and jotting down your ideas. Utilize public spaces like parks for ideation and document your thoughts on paper or digitally.

**Pause and Reflect:** This critical stage involves refraining from immediate action on your ideas. Allow time for contemplation without rushing into execution. Often, initial ideas may not withstand scrutiny, and it takes several months to refine them. Test your ideas by sharing them in casual settings like a noisy pub – if your idea fails to captivate attention, it may need further refinement.

**Conduct Thorough Research:** Before committing to a business idea, delve into market research and solicit feedback from potential consumers. Interact with retailers or relevant stakeholders to gauge market demand and assess the viability of your business concept.

**Craft Compelling Pitches:** Develop concise and engaging pitches for your product or business. Imagine yourself in an elevator with a potential investor or collaborator – what succinct message would entice them to learn more about your venture?

**Embrace Iterative Development:** Prioritize launching your idea early to gather feedback and validate its potential. If the response is lukewarm, be prepared to pivot or iterate on your concept. Continuously seek input from diverse audiences to refine your offering.

**Avoid Debt:** Strive to bootstrap your venture and minimize reliance on external funding. By keeping costs low and testing your idea iteratively, you can mitigate financial risks and retain control over your business.

**Prioritize Hands-On Learning:** Take ownership of all aspects of your business, even if it requires acquiring new skills. Familiarize yourself with technology, business operations, and industry trends to make informed decisions and lead by example.

**Seek Mentorship:** Recognize the value of mentorship in guiding your entrepreneurial journey. Study the experiences of successful individuals, like Aliko Dangote, through biographies or online resources to draw inspiration and insights for your own path.

**Continuous Improvement:** Cultivate a mindset of continuous learning and improvement. Embrace challenges, seek feedback, and adapt your strategies based on market dynamics and emerging opportunities.

In conclusion, success as an entrepreneur requires a blend of creativity, resilience, and strategic thinking. By following these principles and embracing a growth-oriented mindset, you can navigate the complexities of entrepreneurship and chart a path to sustainable success. Stay tuned for next week's installment, where we will delve into essential considerations before transitioning to full-time entrepreneurship.
