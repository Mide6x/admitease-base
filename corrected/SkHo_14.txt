How to Make Soy Milk

Healthy soy milk can be easily made at home. In this article, we will show you how to make your own soy milk at a fraction of the cost compared to store-bought soy milk.

If you make soy milk regularly, consider purchasing an automatic soy milk machine or soy milk maker, as it will save you a significant amount of time.

Step 1 - Soak the Soybeans

Soak your soybeans overnight in a large bowl of water (for approximately eight to twelve hours).

Step 2 - Crush the Soaked Beans

Put the soaked beans in your food blender with some water. Blend for a minute until all the beans are broken down.

Step 3 - Strain the Ground Bean Liquid

Strain the mixture with a muslin or cheese cloth, squeezing the cloth to extract as much liquid as possible.

Step 4 - Boil the Soy Milk

Place the milk on the stove and heat it until it starts to boil. Boil for about 5 minutes or until the milk stops foaming. Remove the milk from the heat and allow it to cool.
