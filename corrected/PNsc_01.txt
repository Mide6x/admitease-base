Traditional Preparations and Uses of Maize

Introduction

Maize (Zea mays L., Poaceae) is the second most vital cereal globally after wheat and rice concerning cultivation areas and total production (Purseglove, 1992; Osagie and Eka, 1998). The term "maize" originates from the South American Indian Arawak-Carib word "mahiz." It is also referred to as Indian corn or simply corn in America (Kochhar, 1986; Purseglove, 1992). The crop was likely introduced to Nigeria in the 16th century by the Portuguese (Osagie and Eka, 1998). In Nigeria, maize goes by various vernacular names depending on the region, such as 'agbado,' 'igbado,' or 'yangan' (Yoruba); 'masara' or 'dawar masara' (Hausa); 'ogbado' or 'oka' (Igbo); 'apaapa' (Ibira); 'oka' (Bini and Isha); 'ibokpot' or 'ibokpot union' (Efik); and 'igumapa' (Yala).

Global maize production is estimated at around 300 million tons per year, with the USA alone producing 145 million tons (approximately 50 percent) (Ihelarouye and Ngoddy, 1965; Kochhar, 1986; Purseglove, 1992). In Nigeria, maize is widely cultivated across the country, from the north to the south, with an annual production of about 5.6 million tons (Central Bank of Nigeria, 1992). Maize cultivation in the country covers approximately 1 million hectares out of the 9 million hectares it occupies in Africa (Hartmans, 1985).

Maize is prepared and consumed in various ways, differing from region to region or among ethnic groups. Maize grains can be boiled or roasted to make pastes like 'eko,' 'abado,' and 'elekute' in Nigeria, 'kenke' in Ghana, or as popcorn, which is popular throughout West Africa. Traditional maize preparation methods are specific to certain localities or ethnic groups, similar to the traditional preparation and uses of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz, Euphorbiaceae) as noted by Etejere and Bhat (1985). The current study on the traditional preparations and uses of maize among different Nigerian ethnic groups aims to provide diverse preparation methods and uses to a broader audience.

Maize is a cereal plant that yields grains used in various food preparations like pap, 'tuwo,' 'gwate,' 'donkunu,' and many others. These food types are readily available in different parts of Nigeria among various ethnic groups, notably the Yorubas, Hausas, Ibos, Ibiras, Ishas, Binis, Efiks, Yalas, etc. Maize grain preparations and uses vary among groups, though with some similarities. Besides food, maize also serves medicinal and industrial purposes. This study discusses about 28 food items or dishes and 6 medicinal uses of maize, aiming to showcase the diverse preparation methods from different ethnic groups.

Methodology

Data collection involved three methods: oral interviews with locals from diverse ethnic backgrounds, field trips to areas where maize is used in preparing porridges or dishes, and consultation of relevant literature.

Preparations and Uses as Food

Maize is a crucial crop that allows for the creation of various food types, possesses medicinal properties, and serves as raw material for industries. The grain is the most essential component of the maize plant, serving multiple purposes.

Pap: In Nigeria, there are two popular types of pap: hot-pap and cold-pap. Hot-pap is known as 'eko-gbona' or 'ogi' (Yoruba), 'akamu' (Igbo and Yala), 'kamun' (Ibira), while cold-pap is 'eko-tutu' (Yoruba), 'kamu' (Isha), 'agidi' (Igbo and Yala), 'kafa' (Hausa).

To prepare paps, maize grains are soaked in cold water in an earthen or clay pot ('koko') for 2 to 3 days. The grains are then washed thoroughly and ground to a paste. Water is added and left to ferment with periodic water changes. The desired amount is then taken, stirred, and added to boiling water, creating a semi-liquid porridge (hot pap). Sometimes, grains of guinea corn (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, Poaceae) are mixed with maize grains, or guinea corn or millet (Pennisetum americanum K. Schum, Poaceae) alone may be used to prepare hot-pap, as described above. Banigo and Muller (1972) discussed an improved method for producing or preparing 'ogi,' which is akin to tea among indigenous Nigerians. 'Koko' is a thin porridge resembling 'ogi' but containing tiny lumps of flour for added texture.

The preparation of cold-pap differs slightly. After grinding the grains, the paste is filtered using a clean, white cloth to obtain a smooth paste. The residue (referred to as 'eri' by Yoruba) from the filtration is used as animal feed or may be sun-dried to make 'pete' by Yoruba. 'Pete' is added to boiling water as a prelude to making 'amala' (a dish made with yam flour). The remaining fine paste after filtration settles at the pot's bottom with water on top. The top water, known as 'omi-eko' or 'omikan' or 'omidun,' is removed, while the paste is added to boiling water and stirred to create a semi-solid porridge. This mixture is then placed in banana leaves (Musa spp. L., Musaceae), or 'ewe-eko' as termed by locals, arranged in a small clay pot (kolobo) to form a characteristic dome shape. Alternatively, it can be placed in polythene paper (nylon)â€”a modern trend. The hot mixture cools and solidifies, becoming a thick porridge (cold-pap). 'Omadidi,' a dish popular among the Isha people, is similar to 'eko' or 'eko'-tutu but denser. The preparation of 'omadidi' involves pouring the partially cooked watery porridge into nylon bags, which are then recooked in a pot of hot water to achieve a more solid consistency than eko.

The primary distinction between hot-pap and cold-pap lies in how they are served or consumed. While 'ogi' and 'koko' are served hot, eko and 'omadidi' are served cold. Pap can be consumed alone, with sugar, bean cakes like 'akara' or 'moin moin' (made from Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., Palpilionaceae), with vegetable stew (e.g., Amaranthus cruentus L., Amaranthaceae), or with groundnut cake ('kulikuli' made from Arachis hypogaea L., Palpilionaceae). A byproduct of pap known as 'eha' or 'eha-koko' (burnt porridge at the pot's bottom) is consumed by both humans and livestock.

Elekute: Dried maize grains are roasted with hot charcoal, ground into fine particles, and mixed with a small amount of granulated sugar to create 'elekute.'

Cooked or Boiled Maize: Freshly harvested maize cobs are cooked or boiled whole until the seeds are soft and consumed on the cob.

Roasted Maize: Freshly harvested maize cobs are roasted over hot charcoal until the seeds turn brown. They are then eaten in this roasted form on the cob.

Medicinal Uses:

Maize, being highly nutritious and edible, also possesses medicinal properties among local communities. It is utilized to treat various ailments, proving to be effective over the years. Some medicinal uses include:

- Water filtered through charcoal obtained from maize stalks can be used to treat gonorrhea (AbdulRahaman, 1997).
- An infusion derived from the stigma of maize inflorescence can treat urinary tract diseases (AbdulRahaman, 1997).
- Water (e.g., 'omi-eko' or 'omikan' or 'omidun') obtained during pap preparation is used to soak the bark or roots of certain plants (e.g., 'dokita igbo'), which is used to treat fever and malaria. Cold-pap water is more effective than hot-pap water for this purpose.
- Cold-pap or 'eko-tutu' is frequently used in traditional medicine. It is combined with specific preparations (usually granulated black particles) to address spiritual issues. It may be prescribed for protection against enemies, warding off misfortunes, or promoting progeny.
- Maize grains are sometimes perforated to create rosaries. These are worn on a child's wrist to prevent them from becoming thin.
- Dried maize cobs and yams, along with certain charms, are planted or buried together to bind a couple together, ensuring they remain husband and wife indefinitely, preventing either party from remarrying.

Conclusion:

Maize is a versatile plant that thrives in a wide range of soils, from coarse sand to heavy clay (Kochhar
