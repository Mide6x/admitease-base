Title: Analysis of Lead and Cadmium Levels in Dry Cell Batteries Available in Nigeria

Abstract: The lead and cadmium content in various brands and sizes (N=38) of dry cell batteries (zinc-carbon Leclanche systems) in Nigeria were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometry after acid digestion. The average lead and cadmium content in the dry cells were found to be 1077.9±751.7 mg/kg (Range 42-3170 mg/kg) and 108.3±81.4 mg/kg (Range 4.6-410 mg/kg) respectively. Dry cells with metal outer covers had significantly lower lead and cadmium levels (p < 0.005) compared to those with non-metallic covers. The highest levels of lead and cadmium were detected in batteries imported from China. The study highlights the importance of implementing proper waste management systems to prevent the open burning of hazardous materials.

Introduction: The management of primary and secondary battery wastes is crucial to prevent environmental and human health hazards. The manufacturing processes of batteries contribute to environmental pollution, particularly lead contamination. Exposure to lead, cadmium, and other toxins in battery manufacturing facilities poses health risks to employees and their families. Proper environmental protection measures are essential to mitigate the adverse effects of battery production and waste disposal.

Conclusion: Dry cells, being non-rechargeable, become hazardous waste when no longer functional. The improper disposal of batteries, including open burning, can lead to the release of heavy metals into the environment, posing risks to human health. Effective waste management practices, including the removal of toxic materials from waste streams and the enforcement of regulations, are necessary to address heavy metal pollution from dry cell batteries.
