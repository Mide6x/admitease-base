Corruption Management – An Alternative Proactive Approach

In recent years, corruption has garnered heightened interest and sparked debates within Nigerian society. Nigeria’s independent media and global commentators regularly evaluate the government's endeavors to combat corruption. This public discourse is crucial in any anti-corruption initiative and is vital for increasing public awareness of the challenges associated with corruption in Nigeria.

In a democratic society, the level of tolerance or intolerance towards corrupt practices by the public determines the success of any anti-corruption crusade. In mature democracies, elected officials respond to public intolerance of corruption by launching investigations and enacting legislation that leads to reform. Therefore, it is hoped that the ongoing public debates and exposure of corruption within Nigeria will reduce the public's tolerance for corrupt practices.

Corruption has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations, with widespread illegality and corruption prevalent. Lipset and Lenz (2000) observed that corruption has been pervasive in complex societies from ancient Egypt, Israel, Rome, and Greece to the present day. While corruption is believed to be common in modern governments, it is not unique to any particular continent, region, or ethnic group. However, the incidence and scale of corrupt activities vary across societies, with some countries more corrupt than others. Regrettably, Nigeria is not among those countries effectively managing corruption, despite the establishment of numerous corruption commissions and the promises made by successive administrations to create a corruption-free society.

Hence, this article advocates for a new approach - managing the challenges posed by corruption in Nigerian society rather than merely reacting to incidents. This proactive strategy aims to contain corruption to a manageable level through a combination of sincere prevention measures and strict remedial actions, with zero tolerance being a key principle.

Corruption is a multifaceted and adaptable problem that impacts various facets of society and has plagued civilizations throughout history. Defining, understanding, and controlling corruption is complex due to differing perceptions of the phenomenon, making it challenging to set realistic anti-corruption goals.

* Is it feasible to strive for the complete eradication of corruption in any society?
* Can a society truly be free of corruption?
While some societies have managed to reduce corruption to minimal levels, none have achieved a corruption-free utopia. Currently, corruption in its various forms is prevalent in all societies, including advanced Western democracies. Transparency International's Annual Corruption Perception Index does not rank any country as achieving a "perfect 10" or "zero corruption."

Instead of fostering unrealistic expectations that corruption can be eliminated, it may be more beneficial to educate the public on the reality that corruption cannot be eradicated but can be effectively managed. Establishing realistic goals and milestones within different sectors of society, particularly government bureaucracies, to effectively manage corruption is essential. Many modern societies with relatively low corruption levels have inadvertently or deliberately adopted such an approach. Hence, developing and implementing an effective corruption management strategy in Nigeria is imperative.

The focus of an effective corruption management strategy should be on both prevention and detection components, as exemplified by the "Vermin Allegory." Just as a vermin control strategy combines prevention and detection methods, a national corruption management strategy should include both aspects to effectively address corruption at all levels of government and society in Nigeria.

While detection mechanisms are more tangible and easier to implement, prevention actions are crucial in effectively managing corruption. It is more cost-effective to prevent corruption than to deal with its consequences. Moreover, prevention efforts are vital as once corruption infiltrates a society, detecting and eradicating it becomes increasingly challenging.

In conclusion, adopting a corruption management approach that merges corporate ethics with anti-corruption tactics is crucial for creating integrity within governance. Successful corruption management not only promotes development, justice, peace, and progress but is also essential for ensuring effective governance and societal advancement.
