When Language Matters

To understand the significance of the contemporary world, we employ a language designed to articulate the world of the past. The lives of our ancestors feel closer to our true selves simply because they are closer to our language. - Exupery, from his book 'Wind, Sand and Stars' (1939).

This month marks the birth of the Arabic language over 1,440 years ago. With the revelation of the Qur'an, the foundation of this language was firmly established in terms of grammar, phonology, and morphology. Prior to the divine revelation of the Qur'an, Arabic existed for thousands of years without a defined syntax. Therefore, Ramadan can be seen as a pivotal month of revolution without which humanity would have remained lost in ignorance.

Language, beyond being a form of communication and comprehension, also serves as a tool for documenting and connecting past events to the future through the present. Language stands as the essence of any culture. A tribe or community devoid of a language exists without a culture.

All languages are initially spoken either orally or through gestures, but writing emerged to record sounds and preserve history. Language is the cornerstone of all civilizations throughout human history. It stands as humanity's greatest invention, without which all other innovations, including scientific and technological advancements, would have been unattainable.

Whether spoken or written, language acts as the primary medium among the various races and tribes of mankind, connecting the past, present, and future. Human births and deaths, the rise and fall of empires, the movements and settlements of nations and tribes are all communicated or chronicled through languages. Even inanimate objects at times resonate sonically, captivating human admiration.

It is through language that every human idea takes root and transforms into reality from mere imagination. Furthermore, language serves as the cultural framework governing life, whether agricultural or aquatic. The nature, significance, complexity, and role of language in human life are such that our world would be devoid of meaning without it.

In the Qur'an 49:13, Allah conveys, "O people! We have created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you might interact with one another. Surely the noblest among you is the most righteous of you. Allah is wise and all-knowing."

The inspiration for this discussion arose from a query posed to me by a Muslim socialite in Lagos. He questioned why we observe Salat in Arabic, a language we may not comprehend fully, suggesting we use English or vernacular languages instead, similar to how Christians worship in various understandable languages in churches. He proposed that such a change could attract more converts to Islam and increase mosque attendance. He further advocated for reducing the frequency of daily prayers for practicality, especially for busy and traveling individuals. This showcases the extent of ignorance that can lead individuals to misguided beliefs. How else can we view someone who seeks to amend the practices ordained by their Creator? Unfortunately, he is not alone in holding such narrow views.

In my response, I inquired why Islam remains the fastest-growing religion in the West, despite worshiping in understandable languages in churches there. I specifically mentioned the situation in Britain, where churches are being converted to mosques due to the increasing Muslim population. I challenged him to name a religion revealed in the English language.

I proceeded to question the feasibility of his employees working only three days a week while being paid for the full week. Seeing the confusion on his face, I emphasized that English, which he deemed ideal, was not an original language. I elucidated how England had been colonized by various empires over centuries, including France, Germany, Italy, and Scandinavia, leading to the amalgamation of their languages into what became English in the 10th century AD. I highlighted that a significant portion of modern English vocabulary was borrowed from French and German, and many consonant clusters in English originate from German or Scandinavian languages. Moreover, I clarified that Britain, comprising England, Scotland, and Wales, is not a monolingual nation as commonly believed; languages like Celtic and Welsh are still actively spoken there.

Subsequently, I delved into the realm of religion, underscoring the original languages of the revelations of the Torah (Talmud) by Prophet Moses, the Psalms by Prophet David, and the Bible by Prophet Jesus, which are in Hebrew. I noted that Jews continue to worship in Hebrew.

In countries like China, Japan, Korea, and India, where Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto, and Hinduism are prominent, worship is conducted in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Hindu languages, respectively. Buddhism boasts a vast following globally, primarily due to the large populations of China and India. Yet, the influence of these religions remains localized to their regions.

In the Western Christian-dominated nations, following the decline of Latin as the official language of the Roman Empire, worship is conducted in various languages based on the country. Germans worship in German, French in French, Spanish in Spanish, and so forth. This diversity implies that a French or Russian individual would struggle to comprehend a church service in Portugal without understanding Portuguese. This diversity is not mirrored in Islam, where adherents from different countries can congregate in any mosque worldwide and worship together in Arabic without language barriers. This universal aspect of Islam is facilitated by Arabic being the language of the Qur'an's revelation. In contrast, adherents of other religions typically worship in their local languages, limiting global inclusivity.

To advocate for abandoning Arabic in Salat is to advocate for the localization of Islam rather than its universal essence. Such a proposition undermines the global unity of Muslims.

Our well-meaning socialite acquaintance fails to grasp that worshiping in Arabic, the language of the Qur'an, is a primary reason for antagonism toward Islam by those detached from the originality of their faith. The divine religions were revealed in the languages of their Messengers, and Prophet Muhammad (SAW) is the only Messenger sent to the entire world.

Arabic has become intertwined with Islam as a cultural entity. This language instilled in Muslims the resilience and fortitude that enabled Islam to withstand centuries of challenges from various empires.

Islam endures as a culture for two key reasons: its spiritual essence transcends physical boundaries, and the Qur'an itself assures its preservation. The cultural strength of a society is closely tied to the vigor with which its language is upheld.

Cultural assimilation can occur where one culture integrates into another without losing its language, or where a language assimilates into another while the cultural identity remains intact. Islam stands steadfast against both scenarios. Early Muslim Arabs disseminated not only Islam but also the Arabic language to conquered territories. The exception was Persia (now Iran), which possessed a robust linguistic tradition. Nations like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Algeria, and Tunisia only adopted Arabic with the spread of Islam.

A similar phenomenon is observed in Nigeria. The Fulanis, led by Sheikh Uthman Dan Fodio, reintroduced purified Islam to what is now northern Nigeria, opting for Arabic over their indigenous languages. In contrast, the Hausas embraced Islam over their pagan practices while maintaining their language. This fusion has granted northern Nigeria a rich cultural tapestry, with the Hausa language becoming internationalized and Sharia law ingrained as a regional Islamic legal system.

While many regions in Southern Nigeria have succumbed to foreign cultural influences, the North presents a beacon of cultural resurgence for Nigeria and Africa. From their attire and culinary traditions to their steadfast use of the Hausa language, the North exemplifies a cultural revival that may soon resonate globally. Major global players already feature Hausa programs on their media platforms. In contrast, Southern Nigeria's inclination toward colonial languages risks eroding their cultural identity without fully grasping the foreign tongues they adopt, leaving them at a loss both presently and in the future.

Although Prophet Muhammad (SAW) advocated for understanding languages beyond one's mother tongue, he did not endorse abandoning one's native language.
