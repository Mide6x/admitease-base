Oando Introduces Electronic Payment to Marketing

Nigeria's leading oil marketing company, Oando Marketing Limited (OML), a subsidiary of Oando PLC, has announced its plans to launch a new electronic payment solution called 'PAYDirect', which is set to commence operations on October 1, 2009.

The company stated that the electronic payment service will be facilitated by InterSwitch to improve customer service across its network of over 500 retail service stations nationwide.

In a statement released by the Head of Corporate Communications, Meka Olowola, the company highlighted that the initiative was developed to enhance product supply chain management and optimize the operational efficiency of its retail outlets, ensuring the availability of petroleum products at all Oando service stations nationwide.

"PAYDirect is an online real-time service primarily designed for OML's cash-paying dealers nationwide. Upon implementation, PAYDirect will significantly reduce payment confirmation time for products from approximately 24 hours to a few minutes through instant notifications to all participating banks, enabling the prompt dispatch of products from any of OML's 20 fuel and lubricant storage facilities directly to the customer's site.

The introduction of the 'PAYDirect' solution further solidifies OML's reputation as a highly efficient player in the downstream sector, having previously successfully integrated the Oracle E-business Suite in 2007 as its primary operating platform.

This solution will offer Oando Marketing dealers several benefits, including expedited processing and release of products, real-time tracking of payments, online account status updates, payment tracking nationwide, access to transaction history reports for easier reconciliation, and elimination of bank verifications for payments to any of OML's accounts.

In response to the initiative, the Chief Operating Officer of OML, Mr. Ayo Ajose-Adeogun, expressed, "As a customer-centric organization, we continuously innovate our processes to ensure exceptional service delivery to all stakeholders. The PAYDirect solution will reduce the order-to-delivery cycle by 24 hours for all our products, regardless of the delivery location."

"The immediate result of this advancement is the rapid return on investment for our dealers and increased confidence among our customers in our stations' ability to meet their petroleum product needs consistently throughout the year, irrespective of their location."

"We take pride in pioneering this initiative in Nigeria, maintaining our leadership in the retail market with innovative products and services."

Oando Marketing recently introduced another customer-centric initiative, Oando Pay-As-U-Gas, which involves dispensing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) into customers' cylinders using a metered pump directly at the station forecourt.

The benefits of the Pay-As-U-Gas service to customers include flexibility, product integrity, convenience, expert after-sales service, and the ability for customers to retain physical possession of their cylinders. This service is currently available at selected service stations in Lagos, Abuja, and Kaduna.

"Oando Marketing Limited is the leading oil retailer in the nation, with one out of every five liters of petroleum products sold or distributed through Oando's extensive network of over 500 retail outlets and strategically positioned terminals. This ensures continuous product supply and availability in Nigeria and the West African sub-region, including Ghana, Togo, and Benin," the statement concluded.
