Abstract
Background
This study reviews the epidemiology and morbidity of Oro-Facial cancers at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH). The objectives were to estimate the incidence and prevalence of Oro-facial cancer at the clinic, highlight the poor prognosis despite better facilities for management, and evaluate factors influencing the poor prognosis.

Patients and Methods
A retrospective study spanning five years involving 211 patients with Oro-facial cancers at the maxillo-facial unit of Ahmadu Bello University, Kaduna, was conducted. The study examined demographic patterns, clinical features, histopathological findings, and treatment modalities obtained from patients' records.

Results
Among the 211 Oro-facial cancers studied, Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 136 (64%), Adenocystic carcinoma 30 (14%), Adeno carcinoma 11 (5%), metastatic carcinoma 8 (4%), and other 26 (13%). Housewives, farmers, and traders comprised 152 (71%) of all patients. 92% (192 patients) presented at an advanced disease stage. The age range was 15 to 84 years, with a median age of 44.5. Males (64%) were more affected than females (36%), with a male to female ratio of 1.8:1.

Conclusion
Public awareness campaigns are crucial to promote early presentation, as the majority of people in this region have access to radio media.

Introduction
Despite advancements in cancer management, Oro-facial carcinoma remains a significant health concern globally, particularly in our environment. Late presentation is a major factor contributing to poor prognosis in Kaduna and its environs. The maxillofacial unit at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital has been a primary surgical center for Oro-facial cancer management in Northern Nigeria, serving an estimated population of 60 million people.

Materials and Methods
Between January 2000 and December 2004, 400 Oro-facial malignancy patients were managed at the maxillofacial unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital. Records of 211 patients were retrospectively reviewed for Oro-facial cancers, analyzing various demographic and clinical factors.

Results
The study included patients aged 15 to 84 years, with a mean age of 44.5. Most patients were males, originating from various regions across the country. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common histological type, primarily affecting the palate. Late presentation, traditional treatment practices, and financial constraints were common among patients.

Discussion
Oro-facial cancer is a severe malignancy that requires prompt treatment to prevent fatalities. Factors contributing to poor prognosis globally include late hospital presentation, lack of awareness, poverty, and cultural beliefs. Tobacco and alcohol abuse also play a significant role in the rising incidence of oral cancer worldwide. Improved public health strategies and early detection initiatives are essential to address this growing public health issue.
