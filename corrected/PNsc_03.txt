What Causes High Blood Pressure?
High blood pressure can eventually lead to the bursting or bleeding of blood vessels in the eye, which can result in blurred vision or other impairments, potentially leading to blindness.

Arteries
As individuals age, arteries in the body progressively "harden," particularly those in the heart, brain, and kidneys. High blood pressure is linked to these "stiffer" arteries, subsequently causing the heart and kidneys to function more strenuously.

Kidney Damage
The kidneys serve as filters to eliminate waste from the body. Over time, high blood pressure can cause the blood vessels of the kidneys to narrow and thicken. This results in decreased filtration by the kidneys, leading to the accumulation of waste in the blood. In severe cases, kidney failure may occur, necessitating medical interventions such as dialysis or a kidney transplant.

Heart Attack
High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart attacks. The arteries supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. Insufficient oxygen supply to the heart can lead to chest pain, known as "angina." Complete blockage of blood flow can result in a heart attack.

Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
High blood pressure is the primary risk factor for congestive heart failure (CHF), a critical condition wherein the heart is incapable of pumping sufficient blood to meet the body's demands.

Various factors can cause high blood pressure, such as arterial narrowing, increased blood volume, or excessive forcefulness of the heart's contractions. Any of these conditions can elevate pressure against the artery walls. High blood pressure may also stem from an underlying medical issue. Often, the exact cause remains unknown. While high blood pressure is generally incurable, it can be effectively prevented and managed in most cases.
