Prostate Issues

The prostate gland is situated just below the bladder in males, surrounding the top part of the urethra, which drains from the bladder. It is responsible for producing the majority of the fluid in semen, which nourishes and transports sperm.

At birth, the prostate is the size of a pea, growing to the size of a walnut by the age of 25. Another phase of prostate growth typically occurs in men in their mid to late 40s, as cells in the middle part of the prostate surrounding the urethra begin to multiply more rapidly. This tissue enlargement, known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), often compresses the urethra, partially blocking urinary flow. BPH affects 50% of men in their 60s and 90% of men in their 70s and 80s. It is essential to note that BPH does not increase the risk of developing prostate cancer.

The symptoms of prostate enlargement vary among individuals, and only about 50% of men with this condition experience significant enough symptoms to seek medical advice. Symptoms may include urinary frequency, difficulty initiating urination, weak urinary stream, starting and stopping during urination, urgency, nocturia, incomplete bladder emptying, hematuria, and urinary tract infections.

The primary risk factor for developing BPH is aging, with other factors including heredity, marital status (married men are more prone to developing BPH), and national origin, as some races have a higher incidence of the condition.

Diagnosis is based on medical history and physical examination. Additional tests may include a digital rectal exam, urine analysis, and a blood test to measure Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Elevated PSA levels may indicate BPH, prostatitis, or prostate cancer.

If tests indicate an enlarged prostate, further investigations such as ultrasound, cystoscopy, urodynamic studies, and urinary flow tests may be conducted.

Complications related to prostate gland enlargement can include difficulty emptying the bladder, leading to discomfort, recurrent bladder infections, and potential kidney involvement.

Treatment is determined based on symptom severity. Options include medications, non-surgical treatments, and surgery. Medications such as Alpha blockers and drugs that shrink the prostate gland may be prescribed. Non-surgical treatments include various heat therapies and the insertion of a prostatic stent to widen the urethra.

Surgical treatment is typically reserved for severe cases, with procedures such as Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), Transurethral Incision of the Prostate (TUIP), and Open Prostatectomy being considered the most effective forms of treatment for BPH.

Lifestyle changes, including regular bladder emptying, avoiding alcohol and caffeinated beverages, and managing fluid intake, can help control symptoms. Complementary and alternative medicine, such as saw palmetto, may also be considered, though it is essential to consult a healthcare provider before use.

It is recommended that all men over the age of 40 undergo annual prostate examinations.
