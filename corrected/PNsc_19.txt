Cough Overview
A cough is a reflex action by your body to expel substances that irritate your air passages, which transport air from the nose and mouth to the lungs. It is triggered when specialized cells along the air passages become irritated, leading to the forceful expulsion of air from the lungs. Coughing can be voluntary or involuntary.

Causes of Coughs
The causes of coughs are diverse and fall into two categories: acute and chronic. An acute cough typically lasts for less than three weeks, while chronic coughs persist for longer durations.

Acute coughs can stem from infectious (due to infections) or noninfectious causes. Infectious causes include viral upper respiratory infections (e.g., common cold), sinus infections, pneumonia, and whooping cough. Noninfectious causes comprise exacerbations of chronic conditions such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, and environmental allergies.

Chronic cough causes can be categorized based on their locations relative to the lungs. These include environmental irritants, lung-related conditions, air passage conditions, chest cavity conditions (excluding the lungs), and digestive issues. Prolonged exposure to environmental irritants like cigarette smoke, dust, pollens, pet dander, chemicals, and low humidity can lead to chronic coughing. Lung-related causes range from common conditions like asthma to less common ones like lung cancer. Persistent coughs may also result from conditions in the upper respiratory tract, chest cavity, or digestive system.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is a frequently overlooked cause of chronic cough, where stomach acid reflux irritates the esophagus and larynx, triggering a cough reflex.

Cough Symptoms
While the presence of a cough is evident, associated signs and symptoms are crucial in determining its cause, especially distinguishing between acute and chronic coughs.
- Infectious causes of acute coughs are often accompanied by fever, chills, body aches, sore throat, nausea, and respiratory symptoms.
- Noninfectious causes may manifest as coughs triggered by environmental factors, wheezing, location-specific exacerbation, or response to specific treatments like inhalers or allergy medications.
- Symptoms of chronic cough can be challenging to pinpoint due to overlapping characteristics of various underlying conditions.
- Environmental irritants can exacerbate coughs, while allergy medications may alleviate symptoms in individuals with environmental allergies. Quitting smoking can improve a smoker's cough.

It is essential to consider these factors when evaluating the underlying cause of a cough.
