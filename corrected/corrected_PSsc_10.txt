Nigerian men are being urged to protect women from situations that may lead to depression. It has been observed that one in every five Nigerian women is experiencing depression.

During a workshop on "Depression in Women: The Way Forward" held in Lagos last week, Mrs. Joke Orelope-Adefulire, the Lagos State Commissioner for Women Affairs, emphasized that poverty is a significant factor contributing to depression among women. She highlighted the importance of not subjecting women to psychological stressors such as bullying, harassment by spouses or superiors, lack of support at home, and emotional challenges.

Dr. Taiwo Ladapo, the Chief Medical Director of the Federal Neuro Psychiatric Hospital in Yaba, attributed the prevalence of depression in women to stressful life circumstances and the unique roles they play within their families. He pointed out that women often bear the brunt of maintaining their households, which can lead to various stressors stemming from family issues like difficult children, uncooperative spouses, and financial hardships.

If left unaddressed, these stressors can cause women to become withdrawn, despondent, and develop low self-esteem, leading to a sense of purposelessness. Depression is a serious condition that can have a profound impact on all aspects of a person's life, including their career, social interactions, self-esteem, and family dynamics. Anyone experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, guilt, fatigue, and overall despondency may be dealing with major depression.

Research indicates that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from depression, with Nigerian women being particularly vulnerable due to their tireless dedication and commitment to their families' well-being. Hormonal changes, childbirth, and the use of contraceptives are cited as factors that can contribute to depression in women, while individuals with rigid mindsets may also be at risk of experiencing depression.

Experts emphasize that depression can be effectively treated since it is a common mental health disorder. However, only 20 percent of those affected seek treatment, primarily due to the stigma associated with psychiatric issues.
