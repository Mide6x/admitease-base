Beyond the Nigerian Nightmare: Yellow-Yellow is a study of the consequences of the sexual encounters between white expatriates in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Children born from such unions often face social stigma, being labeled as "African profit, born throw-ways as Ashawo children, father unknown," carrying these tags throughout life in a community that views them with suspicion.

The novel Yellow-Yellow begins with the tragic event that has become emblematic of the Nigerian nightmare: "During my penultimate year in secondary school, an oil pipeline running through my village ruptured, spilling over several hectares of land, including my motherâ€™s farm... thus, in a single day, my mother lost her primary source of sustenance. However, I believe she had lost that land long ago, as each season yielded less than the one before."

The novel unfolds as both a narrative of escape from village entrapment into a broader world and a cautionary tale of venturing into misadventures, all against the backdrop of the Niger Delta.

This is the story of Zilayefa, known as Yellow-Yellow, conceived from a fleeting encounter with a Greek father whom her mother only knows by name and nationality. It depicts how Zilayefa's mother endeavors to steer her daughter away from a similar path of misfortune, striving to secure a successful future through education, a luxury she lacked. Unfortunately, away from her mother's protective embrace in Port Harcourt, Zilayefa, guided by others, falls into the same traps her mother sought to avoid. She becomes pregnant, not by a playboy expatriate, but by a local sugar daddy, seeking the father figure absent in her life.

The novel concludes with Zilayefa's uncertain resolution: "My life is blurry, and I yearn for the days when my mother planned my path, but I cannot return to what I rejected. I must refocus, and this time, I must do it myself. Everything I had until that moment was handed to me on a platter, and I took it all for granted."

A distinctive aspect of Agary's Yellow-Yellow is her portrayal of women in the Niger Delta. While historically, it has been the male youth voicing concerns of economic, social, and political marginalization in Nigeria, Agary's novel shifts the focus to the plight of Delta women. She illustrates how women in the region suffer at the hands of foreign oil expatriates and local men who discriminate against and oppress them.

Yellow-Yellow delves into the current challenges faced by women in the Niger Delta, highlighting their negative treatment due to human and environmental factors. For these women, environmental sustainability is crucial for their well-being and development, intertwined with their livelihoods, health, and control over their lives.

Agary's novel exposes the exploitation of women by both foreign expatriates and local men in the Niger Delta. Women are forced to sell their bodies, endure abuse, and face discrimination in various aspects of their lives. Agary emphasizes the need for women to be empowered and given opportunities to contribute to the region's growth and development.

In conclusion, Agary's Yellow-Yellow sheds light on the struggles of ordinary women in the Niger Delta, emphasizing the importance of empowering women to facilitate progress and prosperity in the region. By showcasing characters like Sisi and Lolo, who thrive through creativity and hard work, Agary underscores the potential of women to drive positive change in their communities. The novel challenges the discrimination and exploitation faced by women in the region, advocating for their equal participation and contribution to the region's advancement.
