Addressing the Almajiri Issue

The Almajiri phenomenon has persistently eluded solutions from successive generations of policymakers. Nonetheless, in Zamfara State, a novel approach to tackling this problem may offer a solution, as discussed by IMAM IMAM.

Almajiris, distinguishable by their tattered clothing, food bowls, wounds, and pitiful appearance while begging for sustenance, are a common sight in major towns and cities across Northern Nigeria. These children, typically aged between seven and fifteen, attend informal religious schools and wander in search of aid or engage in labor to survive. This description does not always encapsulate the essence of an Almajiri. The term originates from the Arabic word "almuhajirin," meaning "the emigrant." In the Hausa language, Almajiri refers to children attending Quranic schools who seek assistance through begging or labor.

The traditional Almajiri system, known as the Tsangaya model, has arguably outlived its original purpose and now requires a significant overhaul to align with modern demands. Rather than nurturing learned scholars who propagate Islamic teachings, as seen in other Muslim societies, the system has unfortunately become a breeding ground for delinquents and societal misfits.

The Almajiri issue has emerged as a critical social challenge in Northern Nigeria, prompting various expert recommendations on effective interventions. Consequently, a bill is under consideration in the National Assembly to establish a commission addressing child destitution and related concerns. While this bill, sponsored by Senator Umar Tafida, has sparked controversy for overlooking the unique complexities of the Almajiri issue, practical efforts have commenced in Zamfara State.

The Zamfara State Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB) has introduced innovative measures to enhance the welfare and education of Almajiri children studying under Mallams. Initiatives such as integrating the Universal Basic Education (UBE) curriculum with Tsangaya education aim to provide these children with Western education to meet contemporary challenges.

As part of this initiative, the commission has allocated twelve million Naira to twelve selected Quranic schools across the state to improve facilities, living conditions, and educational standards. The goal is to enhance the schools' infrastructure, provide educational materials, and introduce basic English and Mathematics instruction without disrupting their traditional Quranic teachings.

The involvement of traditional rulers has been deemed crucial to address challenges posed by the transient nature of Mallams and students. Stakeholder engagement, including religious and traditional leaders, parents, educators, and NGOs, has been instrumental in fostering support for the UBE scheme. The collaborative efforts aim to ensure the successful implementation of the pilot program and eventual expansion to eradicate street begging among Almajiris.

To ensure the project's success, emphasis is placed on recruiting qualified teachers for the Tsangaya schools. This strategic intervention is essential as the Almajiri issue persists and demands a comprehensive solution. The Zamfara initiative, providing oversight and support to Almajiri children, has garnered positive feedback and may serve as a model for broader implementation with the involvement of relevant stakeholders like the Zakkat board.

In conclusion, concerted efforts to improve the Almajiri system in Zamfara State demonstrate a proactive approach towards addressing this longstanding social challenge. By integrating modern educational practices with traditional Quranic teachings, the initiative aims to uplift Almajiri children and pave the way for a brighter future.
