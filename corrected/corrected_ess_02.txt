Introduction
The interpretation of meaning in natural language has been identified by Ullman (1962) as the most ambiguous and controversial term in the theory of language. The ambiguity in analyzing meaning arises from the fact that one word can be open to various interpretations. Due to the complexities involved in analyzing meaning, various disciplines such as philosophy, anthropology, psychology, and linguistics have shown interest in its study. In an attempt to analyze meaning, Lyons (1977) broke down the concept of meaning and the verb form "to mean" into ten sentences. His analysis reveals that the meaning of meaning varies from one sentence to another, largely influenced by the context and situation of its usage.

Similarly, Firth (1957) viewed meaning as a complex network of relations rather than a standalone entity. He proposed that the interpretation of meaning should be seen in relation to other words rather than as an independent entity within a sentence. Udofot (2004), in her examination of meaning analysis, notes that meaning is the most elusive and contentious phenomenon in the study of language. These controversies surrounding the analysis of meaning can be traced back to historical sources such as Plato's dialogue, "Cratylus," which dates back to Greek philosophers.

The introduction of the nominal theory aimed to address the challenges in analyzing meaning. This theory posits that the relationship between a word and the object it refers to constitutes meaning. While the nominal theory was useful in analyzing concrete nouns and some adjectives, it fell short in explaining abstract nouns and verbs that convey a state of being. Subsequently, conceptual theories emerged, suggesting that the meaning of a word or expression is the concept associated with it in the speaker's or hearer's mind. However, these theories faced criticism for encouraging subjectivity and introspection, thus hindering objective meaning interpretation.

Contextual theories then emerged, focusing on understanding the meaning of words within the context of their usage. Critics argued that not all concepts are observable or subject to contextual analysis, limiting the potential meanings that could be derived. None of these theories provided a comprehensive analysis of meaning in natural language, leading to the development of pragmatics.

Pragmatics, as defined by Ndimele (1997), involves analyzing meaning by considering not only the observable aspects of language events but also the choices and constraints faced by users in social interactions. It incorporates contextual, behavioral, and other theories to interpret meaning in natural language comprehensively. Pragmatics takes into account factors such as context, culture, social norms, and their influence on meaning interpretation. For example, the use of different terms in Yoruba culture to address elders versus peers can only be understood through a pragmatic analysis considering cultural nuances.

In conclusion, pragmatics offers a holistic approach to analyzing meaning by considering various factors such as context, cultural norms, linguistic context, and social interactions. By integrating these elements, pragmatics is considered an advanced theory of meaning interpretation.
