ASSESSMENT OF BUILDING FAILURES IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF LAGOS AND IBADAN

INTRODUCTION

General Background

Buildings are structures that serve as shelters for individuals, their possessions, and activities. They must be properly planned, designed, and constructed to meet the desired standards and aesthetics while ensuring durability, stability, and resistance to various environmental factors. The construction industry is constantly evolving with the introduction of new materials and techniques, necessitating a high level of skill and expertise from the building team, including Architects, Engineers, Contractors (Structural, Mechanical, and Electrical), and the Local Authority.

Building Failure

Failure in building construction refers to any deviation from expected performance. It can be classified as either cosmetic failure, affecting the appearance of the building, or structural failure, impacting both aesthetics and stability. Building failures in Nigeria have been attributed to design faults, construction site errors, and product failures. These failures can result from various factors such as environmental changes, natural and man-made hazards, improper design interpretation, and construction defects.

Maintenance plays a crucial role in restoring buildings to an acceptable standard, with three main types identified: day-to-day, cyclic, and planned maintenance.

This study aims to assess building failures in Nigeria, specifically in Lagos and Ibadan, focusing on identifying causes and proposing solutions to common failures in the region.

The Study Areas

Lagos, located at latitude 6.270N and longitude 3.280E, is Nigeria's second-largest city and a major industrial and commercial hub in Africa, characterized by high population density and economic activities. On the other hand, Ibadan, situated at latitude 7.40N and longitude 4.00E, is the largest city in West Africa, sharing similarities with Lagos in terms of population and industrialization.

Both Lagos and Ibadan feature a mix of high-rise, residential, commercial, and industrial buildings constructed using materials such as reinforced concrete, earth brick, mud, timber, and steel.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

Data for the research was collected through primary and secondary sources. Primary data involved structured questionnaires administered to stakeholders in the building industry, including clients, town planners, architects, and engineers in Lagos and Ibadan. Visual inspections of failed buildings were also conducted to identify failure types and causes on-site, considering structural elements and geological conditions.

Secondary data was obtained from the Nigeria Institute of Building (NIOB), which provided information on failed and collapsed buildings from 1955 to 2002. Interviews were conducted with key personnel at NIOB's secretariat in IKEJA, including a Builder, an Architect, an Engineer, and a Town Planner.
