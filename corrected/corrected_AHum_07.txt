Urhobo Language

All Urhobo people speak and understand a universal language known as the Urhobo language. Despite emigrating from various directions at different times, the ability to communicate in a shared language requires some explanation. There have been no detailed philological studies on the Urhobo language to elucidate its origin and expansion. Several questions arise in the quest to understand the genesis and evolution of the Urhobo language:
i) Were there indigenous people on the land who spoke the Urhobo language before the arrival of foreigners from Benin, Igbo, Ijo, and Isoko?
ii) If most of the founding fathers of the twenty-two kingdoms migrated from Benin, as their traditions suggest, why did the Bini Language not become dominant after the integration of the new settlers into the area?
iii) What caused the diversity of dialects within the Urhobo language?

Any attempts to explain these questions remain speculative. The existence of aboriginal Urhobo inhabitants in the area prior to the arrival of foreigners has not been definitively confirmed. However, oral traditions from the Olomu and Eghwu regions suggest the presence of Urhobo natives before the influx of outsiders. Some of the indigenous people in Olomu, according to Nabofa, were subjugated by the Igboze, who, with their Benin influence, suppressed the Urhobo natives. Similarly, in Eghwu, aboriginal people lost their cultural identity to the newcomers. The survival of the Urhobo language amidst the dominant presence of new settlers can be attributed to its role as the primary means of communication between the natives and the foreigners. It is likely that the newcomers learned the language of the aborigines before exerting their influence.

The reasons why the Benin language could not overshadow the languages of the indigenous communities can be partly explained by the distance and permanent separation of the immigrants from their original homelands. Linguistically, distance contributes to variations in a language from its core to the periphery. An example of this is American English, which significantly differs from British English due to the geographical separation of the two regions. The circumstances that led the migrants to leave their original homes might have been so challenging that they were willing to abandon their native language. Consequently, they might not have held sentimental attachments to their language and were open to adopting a new one.

Over time, these migrants may have forgotten their original language entirely but retained certain words, phrases, or expressions that persisted in the new language. This phenomenon could explain why some words in the Bini language are also found in the Urhobo language, such as "Igho" (money), "ọmọ" (child), and "ese" (blessing), which are pronounced similarly and share the same meanings in both languages.

The Urhobo kingdoms collectively speak a unified Urhobo language, which serves as a crucial tool for cohesion among the kingdoms. They identify themselves as the Urhobo nation, viewing it as both a political and social entity. Their loyalty to the nation is reinforced by their shared linguistic code, enabling seamless communication.

Urhobo Dialects

The question regarding the diversity of Urhobo dialects will be addressed in the following discussion. There are twenty-two dialects in the Urhobo language, corresponding to the twenty-two kingdoms or polities in the region. An individual's dialect indicates the kingdom they originate from. Despite dialectical variations, cultural practices such as food, attire, marriage customs, administrative systems, and religious ceremonies remain largely consistent across Urhobo land. Agriculture and palm collection are traditional occupations, with fishing being an additional livelihood for communities situated along rivers. Burial rites are similarly conducted across all twenty-two kingdoms, reflecting a shared cultural heritage. Apart from dialects, distinguishing individuals from different kingdoms like Agbarha, Udu, or Ephron-Otor from those in Ughelli, Abraka, or Olomu is exceedingly challenging.

In defining dialect, scholars like Andrew Schiller, Doris Welch, Ralph Nicholas, and William Jenkins (1972:356) explain it as a language variety distinct from others, with a specific group of people in a particular geographic location speaking it.

The relationship between the Urhobo language and its dialects is that while all Urhobo people speak, understand, and write in Urhobo, there is no singular core Urhobo language. This observation, as noted by J. Kelly (1969:153), underscores the various forms of Urhobo spoken across the Urhobo division. Although each kingdom may speak a unique dialect, mutual intelligibility exists among Urhobo people from different kingdoms. The existence of dialects is rooted in historical and synchronic language changes resulting from interactions between different groups over time.

Dialects in the Urhobo language are influenced by various factors such as pronunciation, lexicon, and syntax, leading to differences in how words are spoken and understood across different kingdoms. Despite these variations, all Urhobo dialects hold equal status as distinct language varieties within the Urhobo linguistic framework.
