City buses? Check out Weststar
In its effort to strengthen the future of transportation and support various government initiatives aimed at improving transportation, Weststar Associates, the authorized sole distributor of Mercedes-Benz in Nigeria, has introduced a range of city bus models. This was reported by TAJUDEEN ADEBANJO.

The Mercedes-Benz distributor, Weststar Associates, appears to have a forward-looking approach to transportation. As one of the oldest bus manufacturers globally and a market leader in this segment, they have recently launched city buses to enhance the transportation system, thereby alleviating the daily challenges faced by people.

The city bus models, based on the renowned Mercedes-Benz OF1721 chassis, offer seating for up to 50 passengers with a strong emphasis on providing comprehensive solutions for bus customers. These include logistics and fleet management schemes, professional services, and the supply of genuine spare parts.

The introduction of these buses aims to make traveling more comfortable and stylish. Their well-known suspension, reliability, and safety features are enhanced by the superior dynamics of the buses, providing optimism that customers and potential buyers will receive value for their money.

Additionally, Weststar has unveiled a new generation of 26-30-seater buses built on the LO812 and LO915 chassis from Mercedes-Benz to ensure maximum travel comfort. Due to their short wheelbase, these buses are highly maneuverable, making them suitable for narrow streets and areas with limited infrastructure.

Designed for rough roads and offering excellent quality consistent with the Mercedes-Benz brand, these buses are ideal for city transport, school and staff transportation, intercity travel, and executive travel purposes.

Bukola Ogunnowo, the Corporate Communications Officer at Weststar Associates, mentioned that the bus market in Nigeria is undergoing significant changes. This transformation, she pointed out, is fueled by the government's commitment to enhancing infrastructure and redefining the mass transportation system.

With the strengthening of connections between distant locations, there is a growing need for an increase in mass transit vehicles to transport people and goods in a stylish, comfortable, and safe manner.

To enhance the performance of the buses, Mercedes-Benz/Weststar, in collaboration with their strategic partners, is providing professional training on various bus models like Marcopolo, Busscar, Caio, Neobus, and Mascarello to fleet owners and drivers. Technical training is also offered to ensure the buses are operated professionally at all times.

"Weststar is committed to supporting the government's transport initiatives by making these buses available in Nigeria," noted Miss Ogunnowo.

In recent years, these buses have proven to be highly successful in their category. They boast unique characteristics such as elegant bodywork, relatively low emissions, noticeable fuel efficiency, and ease of maintenance.
