GENERAL INTRODUCTION

1.1 INTRODUCTION
Iko [Ìkò] is one of the languages within the Lower Cross (LC) language group. It is a language with limited documentation spoken by the Iko people of Eastern Obolo Local Government Area (L.G.A.), who reside along the Atlantic Coast in present-day Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.
The survival of this language is under severe threat due to the dominance of English, Ibibio, and Obolo languages, as well as the adverse socio-economic conditions in the area (Urua, 2003).
Kuju (1999) suggests that a language becomes endangered when it ceases to be spoken by its younger generation. Fakuade (1999), referencing Hale (1992:23), defines endangerment as "the dominance of a more powerful language." According to Brenzinger, Heine, and Sommer (1991:25), as cited by Ugwoke (1999), an endangered language has fewer than 5,000 speakers. Bamgbose (1993) defines an endangered language as one not used in formal education and limited to in-group communication. Iko meets these criteria and is considered endangered.
The 1996 Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights recognizes Endangered Languages (ELs) and emphasizes the necessity to preserve them as the inherent and non-negotiable rights of their speakers. Unfortunately, Iko does not enjoy this linguistic protection. How can Iko be preserved or integrated into early formal education, as per the Nigerian National Policy on Education, without a comprehensive linguistic structure description?
This research aims to systematically describe aspects of Iko phonology to counteract the language's decline towards extinction.

1.2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON IKO

1.2.1 THE PEOPLE
The Iko people inhabit the southern tip of Akwa Ibom State in Nigeria, specifically located at N40 31.51 and E70 46.61. Little is known about their migration history, as it remains shrouded in secrecy. The people claim to have resided in their current location for generations, with their ancestors initially settling along the Atlantic Coastline and the island of Iko Nta. The harmful effects of oil exploration by companies like EXXONMOBIL, TOTAL-FINA-ELF, and SHELL PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT COMPANY have impacted the natural environment of Iko communities. However, this is not the focus of this research.
The primary occupations of Iko males include high-sea fishing and boat building, while women engage in subsistence fishing, farming, and selling fish.
Estimating the population of Iko people varies, with figures ranging from 5,000 to 30,000. Our calculation based on 1991 census data places the population at 3,870, differing from other estimates due to computation errors.

1.2.2 THE LANGUAGE
Iko is classified by Essien (1991) and Urua (2000) as part of the Ibibiod group or Ibom languages by Udoh (1998), within the Lower-Cross subfamily. Despite having approximately three million speakers collectively, Ibibiod languages are considered minority languages in Nigeria compared to major languages like Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. Iko faces similar challenges due to its minority status.
Despite geographical proximity to Obolo, Iko is distinct linguistically, lacking mutual intelligibility with Obolo. However, there is some level of mutual intelligibility between Iko and its eastern neighbor, Ibeno.

1.2.3 THE LINGUISTIC SITUATION IN IKO
Iko lacks an orthography and detailed phonological description, hindering the development of teaching materials. It is primarily used informally within the community and in religious contexts. The language is threatened by English, Ibibio, and Obolo, which compete for dominance in the region.
English is the official language of Nigeria, promoting social mobility. Iko students are encouraged to excel in English, often at the expense of their native language. Ibibio serves as the unofficial lingua franca of Akwa Ibom State, further overshadowing Iko. Obolo, the dominant language in Eastern Obolo L.G.A., is also a significant threat to Iko due to its standardized status and orthography.
As the usage of Iko diminishes over time, especially among the youth, intervention is crucial to prevent the language from disappearing.
