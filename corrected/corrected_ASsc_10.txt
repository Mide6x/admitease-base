Trend of Induced Abortions in Ilorin, Nigeria

SUMMARY
Context: Induced abortion remains a major cause of maternal mortality in developing countries. Reports from Nigeria indicate its contribution to maternal death ranges between 15-40%. The Prevention of Maternal Mortality Project, which aims to reduce hospital delays in treating complications from induced abortion, was established in Ilorin over a decade ago. There is a need to assess its impact on mortality from induced abortion.
Objectives: To determine the social-demographic factors associated with induced abortion complications. To identify mortality patterns from induced abortion in Ilorin. To compare the results with previous findings at this center.
Study Design: A descriptive retrospective study. Data was collected from the case notes of patients treated for induced abortion complications in a teaching hospital in Nigeria to identify social-demographic factors associated with induced abortion. Outcome measures included maternal death, specific complications, and prevalence of induced abortion.
Results: Induced abortion accounted for 3.28% of gynecological admissions. The case fatality rate was 61.0 per 1000. Multiple complications were common, with the age group of 24 years and below representing 73.05% of cases. The main causes of death were hemorrhage and septicemia.
Conclusion: Mortality from induced abortion has not significantly decreased despite the implementation of the Prevention of Maternal Mortality Project in Ilorin. There is a necessity to redefine intervention strategies. Efforts to increase contraceptive use, especially among single women, will reduce unwanted pregnancies and subsequently decrease induced abortions and related complications.

INTRODUCTION
Induced abortion is a persistent issue in maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide estimates suggest that approximately 19 million unsafe abortions are performed annually, with the vast majority in developing countries. Unsafe abortion, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to pregnancy terminations where the operator and/or the environment and technique fail to meet the required safety standards. In Nigeria, an estimated 610,000 unsafe abortions are performed by women aged 15 to 44 years. Managing complications from induced abortion strains the limited human, financial, and material resources of many African nations. The proportion of abortions among women aged 15 to 20 years is increasing, with approximately 50% of induced abortions in Nigeria carried out by women in this age group. Most complications are seen in this age group as well. Preventing unwanted pregnancies could prevent a significant number of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and maternal deaths resulting from induced abortion. Immediate complications include hemorrhage, injuries to the genital tract and bowel, post-abortal sepsis, and psychological trauma. Death typically results from sepsis and hemorrhage, while many others suffer severe morbidity affecting their future reproductive health. This study aims to follow up on previous research and observe changes in the trend of induced abortion in Ilorin ten years after the introduction of the Prevention of Maternal Mortality Project.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study reviewed the case notes of patients treated for induced abortion complications at Ilorin University Teaching Hospitals from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2001. Data on demographic characteristics, including age, marital status, parity, gestational age at termination, previous pregnancy terminations, contraceptive history, reasons for induced abortions, types of complications, treatments provided, and outcomes, were collected. The morbidity and mortality data were compared with previous studies at the center to analyze the trend of induced abortion.

RESULTS
During the five-year review period, there were 103 cases of induced abortion out of 3145 gynecological admissions, making up 3.26% of the admissions. There were five deaths, resulting in a case fatality rate of 6.10%. The demographic characteristics of the patients showed that the majority were young, with the age group of 20-24 years having the highest number of cases. Most patients were single and nulliparous, with a significant correlation between unmarried and nulliparous status and complications related to induced abortion. A large portion of patients were not using contraception. Complications included incomplete abortion, post-abortal hemorrhage, lower genital tract trauma, pelvic abscess collection, uterine perforation, and intestinal injuries. Various treatments were provided, including antibiotics, uterine evacuation, blood transfusion, laceration repair, exploratory laparotomy, and other surgical procedures. The mortality pattern for induced abortion in Ilorin over fourteen years showed fluctuations in the percentage of teenagers seeking abortion and mortality rates, with hemorrhage and post-abortal sepsis being the major causes of death consistently.
