Shopping for the Perfect Suit

A suit is an essential item for every man to own. We acknowledge its ability to endure and remain timeless. Without suits, men would lack a crucial element. In the realm of style, a well-fitted suit is a man's ultimate asset. It exudes success, refinement, and elegance. A suit is crafted to enhance your appearance, transcend social barriers, and make a shorter man appear taller with pinstripes or a heavier man look refined in soft wools. A suit is versatile and suitable for various occasions like restaurants, trains, buses, dinner parties, the office, and any place you wish to be. It is, at its finest, a complete ensemble that will never disappoint you. So why not revel in its enduring charm?

And that is precisely what it will do if you care for it properly. Regrettably, the majority of suits you encounter look unappealing. This does not have to be the case. Even if you wear your jacket for long hours, being mindful of your attire will keep you prepared for social events after work. Many men either lack the interest or the knowledge of how to wear a suit appropriately. This is a pitfall worth avoiding.

When choosing a suit, there are a few fundamental rules to keep in mind, most of which are applicable to dressing well in general. Regardless of the style, a suit should fit your body snugly. This means all components should be tailored to suit your physique.

You are a fascinating, self-assured, diverse individual. Let others perceive this through your actions, not merely the brand on your jacket. A modestly and tastefully dressed man has never failed to make an impression.

Unless you are in a profession like investment banking, you do not need a vast collection of suits; having the basic four is sufficient. This allows you to be a discerning shopper, investing time in acquiring and maintaining your suits in good condition (it is better to have experts dry clean them rather than risking damaging them yourself)!

You can purchase suits at various shopping centers nationwide. The local market offers more competitive prices due to better bargaining power. Suits at most malls start from N25,000. Vendors offering lower prices often claim it as a promotional deal. With good negotiation skills, you can find quality suits for even less at certain markets.

The Essential Four:
• The Standard Blue:
Ideal for business meetings, lunches, dinners, or casual gatherings. It pairs well with black or brown shoes and can even be daringly styled with white. It looks exceptional by a pool. Opt for a navy shade without veering towards lighter hues.
• The Classic Gray:
Suitable for all occasions and can even make a red-headed individual look dapper. Gray suits work well with patterns, especially those in the chevron family. Start with plain designs and progress to window-pane patterns. Gray suits are never controversial; they are the epitome of versatility.
• The Basic Black:
A timeless favorite suitable for events like the Oscars or your sister's wedding. It complements a crisp white shirt perfectly and is adored by professionals, fashion designers, and even undertakers (professions that demand a keen fashion sense encompassing respectability, assertiveness, vanity, and sagacity). If you were to own just one suit, let it be black. You can even be laid to rest in it.
• Any of the above options with pinstripes.
