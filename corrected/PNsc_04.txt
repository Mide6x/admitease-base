Pediatrician Raises Awareness on Gastroenteritis

Vomiting and diarrhea are common diseases that are spread during the rainy season. Mothers are advised to be vigilant in identifying symptoms early and seek medical help promptly for their children.

According to Dr. Edamisan Temiye, a consultant pediatrician at Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) in Idi-Araba, the condition mentioned is known as gastroenteritis and is widespread during the wet season.

Dr. Temiye explained that the virus causing gastroenteritis is more prevalent during the rainy season, leading to many children falling ill with the disease. Symptoms typically include mild fever, followed by diarrhea and vomiting. If left untreated, the child may become dehydrated due to fluid loss, which can be fatal.

To address the situation at home, Dr. Temiye emphasized the importance of replacing lost fluids and electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, chloride) during vomiting and diarrhea. Oral rehydration support (ORS) is crucial to replenish these essential elements.

He highlighted the significance of maintaining a clean environment to prevent the disease, as water contamination during the rainy season can contribute to its spread. Additionally, stagnant water from various sources can serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes, leading to illnesses like malaria.

Dr. Temiye pointed out that symptoms like vomiting and frequent stooling can also be associated with other conditions such as malaria or typhoid fever. Misdiagnosis and improper treatment, particularly in cases of malaria resistance to chloroquine, can lead to prolonged illnesses and severe symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea, especially in children.

He cautioned against relying solely on the widal test for diagnosing typhoid fever, as it may not always be accurate, leading to unnecessary treatments. Proper diagnosis and adherence to government guidelines on malaria treatment are essential to prevent complications and ensure appropriate care for patients.
