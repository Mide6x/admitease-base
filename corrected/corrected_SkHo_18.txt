Cracked Wide Open

The journey towards spiritual growth and an "Awakening of my life's purpose" (inspired by Eckhart Tolle's book) is not a quick fix, but I am grateful that the seed has been planted. I am realizing that being cracked open is the only way we will truly awaken to the fact that we are more than our physicality, perceptions, and positions. We often seek fulfillment in the wrong things, a truth highlighted by the fact that both the rich and the poor experience suffering.

One of the most charismatic individuals I had the pleasure of knowing was a messenger at the Nigerian Stock Exchange, affectionately known as Oga Bonny. Despite his advanced age and humble role, he carried himself with such grace and dignity that he naturally commanded respect from everyone. The title "Oga" translates to "master" in Nigerian Pidgin English, and even the head of the exchange referred to him as such. His contentment always struck me as remarkable, especially considering his modest earnings as a messenger.

Reflecting on Oga Bonny, I am reminded of the serene dignity exuded by Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. Both men possess an alluring quality of stillness that draws people towards them. They understand a fundamental truth that eludes many of us – that God exists in the present moment, not in the past or future. This concept is exemplified in Exodus when God declares, "I am who I am," emphasizing His presence in times of need.

While I appreciate the various messages I receive, I am particularly compelled to assist those who, like me, seek deeper meaning and fulfillment beyond the superficialities of life. Amidst the noise of trivial concerns, I advocate for embracing inner stillness, transcending boundaries of race and creed. By finding peace within ourselves, we can release the grip of the ego – the source of grievances and conflicts.

As the Native Americans believe, the antidote to afflictions often lies within close proximity to the problem. I advocate not for radical change but for mastering our minds, slowing the tumult of thoughts to allow inner peace to prevail. Embracing stillness is inevitable; the choice lies in whether we achieve it harmoniously or through tumultuous upheavals.

Individuals who undergo near-death experiences often undergo profound transformations, embracing peace wholeheartedly. However, must we wait for dire circumstances to embrace the serenity within? The choice is ours – to persist in frantic pursuits, detached from our essence, or to surrender to a higher power that guides us towards fulfillment beyond our wildest dreams.

If your life yearns for deeper meaning and joy, it is time to surrender to the essence of existence. Forgiveness, reliance on an innate power, and joyful presence in the present moment are keys to healing and fulfillment. Bitterness and hate only breed destruction; it is time to pause, reconnect with our inner source, and willingly embrace the present moment.

Do not await external forces to crack you open; instead, open yourself willingly to the transformative power of the present. Just as God exists in the now, you too are a manifestation of the present moment.
