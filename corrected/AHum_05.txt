Explaining Culture and Religion

Culture

The concept of culture, as defined by E. Tylor, simply means that it is the "complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society." The simplest definition is given by Robert Bierstedt who states, "Culture is the complex whole that consists of all the ways we think and do everything we have as members of society." In all definitions of culture, there are identifiable components. Firstly, culture is shared, meaning that it only makes sense within groups of people. It serves as a common satisfier of people's needs and demands.

The second component is that no society can exist without a culture. All known human societies, whether urban or rural, simple or complex, have cultures that are distinct to them. Culture provides the basic common understanding and sense of belonging necessary for societies to exist. The rules guiding behavior and social order are provided by shared culture.

A direct implication of this is that culture is learned, and learning can only occur through interaction between two or more persons. Cultural transmission is facilitated through learning, thereby ensuring the preservation and transmission of culture from one generation to the next. It is through these processes that culture is preserved, allowing us to discuss religious beliefs and practices, customs, folkways, traditions, mores, and norms. Teaching and learning the ways of a culture may be conscious through direct instruction or unconscious through imitation. This process is commonly referred to as socialization, which involves the learning and internalization of all behaviors not biologically determined.

The third component, of significant importance, is that culture is dynamic. It changes over time; most cultural practices witnessed today have evolved over the years. Many have been influenced by modernization and industrialization. The African belief system appears to be particularly affected in this regard.

Religion

The concept and idea of religion hold different meanings for different people. Philosophers from Plato in ancient Greece to the present day have presented various arguments to prove the existence of God. While some argue that God does not exist, others, like the German philosopher Nietzsche, claim that God once existed but is now considered dead. From a psychological perspective, religion represents a continuation of a child's conception and attitude towards their father into adulthood. According to Sigmund Freud, due to man's realization of his weaknesses and helplessness in the face of life's challenges—such as death, disease, poverty, disaster, and trauma—he seeks protection for himself. This search finds meaning in no living creature other than the creation of an imaginary being or father in God. Psychologists view this behavior as a projection of a child's image of their father, extended into the realm of the supernatural. Therefore, most religions, if not all, turn to God (akin to a child turning to their father) in times of need and difficulties.

From a sociological perspective, religion is seen as a creation of society. According to Durkheim, society creates and utilizes religion as a tool to control, shape, and direct their thinking and behavior. Durkheim's theory of religion views God as a personification of the pervasive forces of society, where all the laws and commandments of God represent the demands that society places on its members for self-preservation.

Marxists view religion as the "opium of the masses," adopting an economic theory of exploitation to explain religion. They believe that religion represents man's self-alienation, with a focus on understanding why individuals turn to religion, thereby alienating themselves. Marxists argue that the exploitation of the masses by the wealthy leads to the encouragement of religion and its growth to maintain control over the masses and prevent rebellion. The term "opium" is used to describe religion as a sedative for the masses. Theologians, on the other hand, view religion as man's search for its source. This quest for the infinite spirit, which constitutes man's source, forms the basis of religion.

As there are numerous theorists, disciplines, and philosophers, there exist multiple theories and explanations regarding the concept of religion. The term "religion" derives from three Latin words: "Ligare" (to bind), "Relegere" (to unite or link), and "religio" (relationship). The etymology of the word 'religion' essentially signifies a link established between two entities, namely human beings and divine beings. This relationship unites man with a transcendental being or deity that humans believe in and worship. The significant influence and hold that religion exerts on human life cannot be overlooked when explaining or interpreting human behaviors. Religion has played a crucial role in shaping and controlling human beings, as well as manipulating and indoctrinating them throughout history. Discussions about miracles, faith in God, belief systems, etc., all exemplify humanity's encounters and experiences with the concept of religion and their ideas about God.

Religion plays a vital role in the lives of believers, providing a revitalizing and cohesive element that helps individuals find meaning and purpose in life. It encourages them to lead moral lives by offering incentives (such as eternity) to do so. All major religions worldwide promote peace and love for all of God's creations. Many individuals facing frustration have found solace and meaning by turning to religion, even though the expansion and growth of various religious groups have been marred by conflicts. Omorogbe noted that without the consolation, meaning, and courage provided by religion, there would likely have been more cases of suicides among frustrated individuals who perceive their lives as meaningless and not worth living.

The Linkage Between Culture and Religion

Culture and religion are closely intertwined. All major religions worldwide have their origins, beliefs, and practices deeply rooted in the cultures in which they developed. Their doctrines often mirror the worldview of their respective cultures. Understanding any religion is virtually impossible without comprehending the culture from which it emerged. This explains why many early European writers and missionaries misunderstood African Traditional religion—they lacked an understanding of the African culture in which this religion flourished.

All major religions—such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Islam, and Christianity—evolved from the cultural contexts of their times. Consequently, their practices and belief systems are deeply embedded in their respective cultures. For instance, comprehending Christianity necessitates an understanding of the Jewish-Greco-Roman culture, just as understanding Islam requires insight into Arabic culture. Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, or Jainism cannot be grasped without knowledge of Indian culture, and Taoist or Confucian religions are best understood within the Chinese cultural context. Appreciating Chintoist religion similarly requires an understanding of Japanese culture.

Since all religions are products of specific cultures and no single culture can be deemed the exclusive approved culture by God for the entire world, no one culture or religion can claim superiority over others. No individual can impose their cultural values, as expressed through their religion, on the entire world. The dynamic nature of culture introduces change, which is often met with resistance. Change, a universal aspect of human life, is invariably resisted. The resistance to the dynamism of culture often leads to extremisms in various religious groups, where adherents believe that cultural practices should remain unchanged. Deviations from original practices are usually met with resistance and, in many cases, violence. Religious extremists may oppose government policies and advocate for stricter alternatives, as seen in the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and some Islamic extremists in Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi State initially formed in collaboration with the Wahhabi religious movement, establishing laws to enforce compliance with Wahhabi interpretations of Islam. Given that much of the Saudi government's legitimacy is rooted in the country's role in Islam, Saudi Arabia practices the strictest application of Islamic law. Presently, the ruling elite in Saudi Arabia faces opposition and challenges from religious extremists within the country, supported by fundamentalists outside. These groups accuse the ruling class of lacking religious devotion and aligning too closely with the anti-Islamic West.

Culture, Religion, and Terrorism: Any Connection?

The question to explore here is whether terrorism can be associated with any specific culture or religion. Can the perpetuation of violence and counter-violence—the suffering and destruction inflicted on society daily—be attributed to cultural or religious imperatives? Furthermore, is the indiscriminate use of violence a sanctioned method of conflict resolution in any culture or faith? Is violence employed as a tool for conversion in any religious context? Does violence in any form promote the recruitment of more followers or adherents? Is jihad synonymous with armed rebellion against the existing social order? Can the boundaries of any religion be expanded in an environment rife with insecurity and rampant destruction of lives and property? Do individuals simply utilize the name of God or Allah to pursue hidden agendas or motives?

To address the fundamental questions raised here, we will delve into the fundamental doctrines of two major world religions—Islam and Christianity. These religions are chosen for examination due to their origins in the Middle Eastern region and the dominance of two distinct cultures, namely Arabic and Western cultures. Moreover, many recent terrorist hotspots, such as the Middle East, Chechnya, Kosovo, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Algeria, are located in regions marked by predominant Muslim culture or, as seen in Northern Ireland, dominant Christian culture. It is noteworthy that there are other crisis areas globally, like the Sabastisia guerilla in Mexico, the drug cartel in Colombia, and the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia, where religious culture is not employed as a propaganda tool.

To establish a robust foundation for our conclusions, religious scholars—both Muslim and Christian—were consulted. Focused interviews were conducted with Muslim scholars and imams to ascertain whether Muslims, in general, advocate violence or terrorism, given that terms like extremists, fanatics, fundamentalists, separatists, and Islamic militants are often used to describe terrorists. The consensus among the interviewed
