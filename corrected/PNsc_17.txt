Gum Disease May Increase Cancer Risk

Researchers have found that gum disease may increase the risk of developing cancer. Male health professionals participating in a long-running study showed a 14 percent higher overall risk of developing cancer if they had a history of gum disease.

In a study published in the journal Lancet Oncology, Dr. Dominique Michaud from Imperial College London and colleagues stated, "After controlling for smoking and other risk factors, periodontal disease was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung, kidney, pancreatic, and hematological (blood) cancers."

This elevated risk persisted even in individuals who had never smoked. Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is an infection of the tissues supporting and surrounding the teeth. Previous research has indicated that people with periodontal disease are more likely to develop heart disease and diabetes.

According to Dr. Kabir Muhammad, a dental surgeon at Dans Medical Centre and Dental Clinic on Ikorodu Road in Ketu, Lagos, gum diseases can be prevented through regular tooth brushing and flossing. Dr. Muhammad emphasized the importance of proper brushing techniques and regular flossing to maintain oral health.

He advised, "Regular tooth brushing means brushing your teeth twice daily, preferably in the morning and at night. It is more beneficial to brush your teeth after meals in the morning and make it the last thing you do at night. Brushing is not to increase appetite but to eliminate food debris left in the mouth after eating."

Dr. Muhammad highlighted the significance of dental floss in cleaning between teeth where brushes cannot easily reach. Dental floss is recommended over toothpicks, as toothpicks can damage gums and teeth, leading to periodontal diseases.

In conclusion, Dr. Muhammad stressed the importance of dental check-ups every six months to maintain oral health and prevent gum diseases. Early detection and treatment of oral issues are crucial to avoid complications in the future.
