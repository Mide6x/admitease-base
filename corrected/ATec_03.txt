Adsorption Kinetics and Intraparticulate Diffusivities of Hg, As, and Pb Ions on Unmodified and Thiolated Coconut Fiber

Abstract: Mercury (Hg), Arsenic (As), and Lead (Pb) are heavy metals commonly found in various industrial effluents, contributing to environmental pollution. Traditional methods of removal such as chemical precipitation and ion-exchange are costly and often insufficient to meet environmental regulations. Biosorption, utilizing natural solids to bind heavy metals, presents a cost-effective and efficient alternative for treating industrial effluents. This study examines the kinetics of biosorption using coconut fiber for the adsorption of As (III), Hg (II), and Pb (II) ions. The specific surface area and surface charge density of coconut fiber were determined to be 1.186 × 10^25 (m^2/g) and 5.39 × 10^24 (meq/m^2) respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity was highest for Pb (II), followed by Hg (II) and As (III). Thiolation modification of the adsorbent impacted the adsorption capacity. Equilibrium sorption was achieved within 60 minutes. The study revealed that sorption followed a particle-diffusion model, with pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models describing the sorption rates, showing a better fit for the pseudo-second-order model. The results demonstrate that both unmodified and modified coconut fiber are effective adsorbents for removing toxic metals from industrial effluents.

Introduction: Heavy metals such as As, Hg, and Pb pose significant risks to human health, plants, and animals. Their presence in industrial effluents from various sources has long been known to cause environmental harm. The chemical nature of these metals is complex and poses challenges when they enter biological systems. For example, arsenate oxy-anions exist in multiple species depending on pH levels, with arsenic known to cause severe health issues. Lead is a known poison affecting hemoglobin synthesis, while mercury is highly toxic in its vapor form. The treatment and recovery of these heavy metals from wastewater have led to extensive research on adsorption techniques using various adsorbents, including agricultural by-products and biological materials.

Materials and Methods: Analytical-grade reagents were used in this study. Coconut fiber obtained from a local market in Nigeria was processed, activated, and divided into modified and unmodified parts. Surface characteristics of the unmodified coconut fiber were determined, including specific surface area, surface charge density, and other parameters. Adsorption experiments were conducted using metal ion solutions, and intra-particulate diffusivities were calculated. The study also involved thiolation modification of the adsorbent to assess its impact on adsorptive capacity.

Results and Discussion: The study found that coconut fiber exhibited high sorption capacity due to its specific surface area and surface charge density. Adsorption experiments revealed higher adsorption of Pb (II) followed by Hg (II) and As (III) ions. Thiolation modification of the adsorbent showed a decrease in adsorption capacity. The adsorption mechanisms were attributed to intrinsic adsorption and columbic interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates. Kinetic models, including pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order, were used to analyze the sorption rates of metal ions.

Equilibrium and Thermodynamic Treatment: The efficiency of metal ion removal on the adsorbent was calculated to assess the sorption process.
