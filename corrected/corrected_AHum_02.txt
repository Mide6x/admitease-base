"The Teller in the Tale: Reading Modernist Narrative Strategies in the Novels of Biyi Bandele-Thomas"

Introduction

Despite the extensive critical commentary on the African novel, there is a lack of in-depth study regarding the modernist trend within the African novel context. Critics have mainly approached the subject from socio-cultural or socio-historical perspectives. Discussions on the African novel often focus on Africa's colonial history, which significantly impacted the African identity, initially aimed at restoration by the first generation of African novelists. Critics also analyze Africa's disillusionment with its independence, highlighting the continent's economic challenges and crises. These themes explain Charles Nnolim's assertion that "African literature in the 20th century operated on a narrow canvas" (2).

Many critics hastily conclude that modernism reflects a response to the deteriorating conditions of modern life. While this perspective holds true, this discourse argues that modernism is an imaginative response to the impossibility of originality, interpreting the modernist call for innovation not as a defensive mechanism but as creative and innovative.

Modernism, originating from the Western tradition, reached its artistic peak in the early 20th century. The concept dominated the world at the turn of the 20th century, ushering in a new world order that challenged and frightened humanity. Virginia Woolf famously remarked that "on or about December 1910 human nature changed" (1), suggesting a significant shift in historical continuity. The cataclysmic events of the 20th century, especially the two world wars, profoundly altered human history and influenced literature's evolution.

Despite its elusive nature, modernism defies a precise definition. Terms like primitivism, formalism, and alienation are fundamental in categorizing modernist principles. Modernism signifies a paradigm shift in aesthetics and cultural sensibilities post-World War I, disrupting the ordered worldview of the 19th century and presenting a pessimistic view of a society in disarray. Unlike 19th-century artists who believed in progress, modernists challenge traditional forms and social norms, portraying a culture in turmoil.

Alan Munton defines modernism as "a radical dissatisfaction with the commonsense view of the real" (12), emphasizing a departure from conventional norms. The modernist novel's structure evolves from a linear to a fragmented form, focusing more on the individual self than on societal constructs. Modernism thrives on radical innovation and experimentation, reflecting a period of upheaval and disorder in society.

The Modernist Tradition in the African Novel

Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart" was the first African novel to gain international acclaim, though it emerged after the peak of modernism. Achebe's subsequent works, like "No Longer At Ease," reflect modernist themes, addressing the chaos of the 20th century. African writers, influenced by colonialism and post-independence challenges, have adopted modernist writing styles to depict their societies' complexities.

Colonialism's aftermath and the struggle for independence shaped Africa's modernist literary tradition. The disillusionment post-independence revealed the impossibility of returning to a pre-colonial innocence, leading to the emergence of modernist elements in African literature. Writers like Amos Tutuola and Biyi Bandele-Thomas embraced modernist techniques in their works, reflecting the societal upheavals of their time.

Biyi Bandele-Thomas, a prominent Nigerian novelist, contributes to the modernist resurgence in Nigerian literature. His novels, rich in scatological imagery, portray Nigeria's moral and physical decay amidst vivid symbolism. Bandele-Thomas' works delve into themes of decay and renewal, using unconventional narratives to explore societal issues.

While this discourse focuses on Bandele-Thomas's narrative strategies, it is essential to outline the key features of a modernist text:
i. Perspectivism: Emphasizing individual viewpoints and personal perspectives within the narrative, incorporating multiple voices and contrasting perspectives.
