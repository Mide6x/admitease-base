Gift-giving is something cherished by all, especially when it is a thoughtful gift. When considering what to give someone, many individuals often head straight to the stores. But what should you buy, and what type of gift should you offer? This is the focal point of my discussion.

I am acquainted with a remarkable woman who holds a high position and wields significant influence. You can imagine the sway a woman holds when her husband is a prominent figure in society. Take, for example, the wife of a president or a governor - her influence is undeniable.

Observing the influence that First Ladies wield, starting from Mrs. Mariam Babangida, many aspire to attain such status. However, it is not easily achieved. Some have suggested that marrying a governor is one of the simplest ways for a woman to gain influence. Yet, I admire individuals like Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Florence Ita Giwa, Hillary Clinton, Dora Akunyili, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, and Angela Merkel, who have carved out their own paths rather than solely relying on their husbands' status. I also appreciate figures like Oluremi Tinubu, Abimbola Fashola, Turai Yarâ€™Adua, and others who, despite their influential positions, remain graceful, humble, and accommodating.

However, the focus of this discussion is not on women or First Ladies but on the act of giving. I was mentioning my influential female friend. Her husband holds a prominent position, both in the past and presently. While she is undeniably beautiful, I consider her a flawed beauty. Admiring her from a distance might be preferable, as a closer look may reveal flaws in her character.

I singled out my flawed friend, who is older and could be considered a motherly figure. I genuinely admire her; meeting with such an influential individual would bring joy to anyone, let alone getting to know them closely. I have had the privilege of getting to know many influential figures, and I have learned that appearances can be deceiving.

My initial disappointment stemmed from the type of gifts she bestowed upon people. If she ever gifted you something, those close to her would advise you to check the expiration date, as the gifts were often expired. Due to her high status, receiving gifts from her was a significant event, and the mere fact that the gifts came from her made the recipients feel grateful. Nigerian culture, especially the Yoruba tradition of kneeling and prostrating, added to the sense of honor bestowed upon the recipients. However, upon realizing that the gifts were expired, the recipients felt disillusioned. It seemed that she would give away items that had been left in storage for too long, merely because she had an abundance of them and did not have to spend money on them, thanks to her husband's position and goodwill.

Furthermore, her frequent travels abroad played a role in the quality of gifts she distributed. On one occasion, she returned and announced gifts for her staff, only for some to display worn-out and visibly old clothes weeks later. She reprimanded them for not using the gifts, oblivious to the fact that the gifts were unsuitable for use.

It is perplexing to witness individuals in positions of power boasting about their achievements while neglecting the essential needs of the masses. Whose money is it anyway? Why not undertake meaningful endeavors and leave a positive legacy?

For instance, when someone digs a borehole for a village, the villagers express gratitude, yet their basic needs remain unmet. Citizens plea for their rightful share of democracy's benefits, but their requests often go unanswered. It is disheartening to see resources hoarded while others suffer in poverty. During the N25 billion bank recapitalization, individuals deposited funds in banks, only for the money to be transferred abroad shortly after, similar to activities in the stock market. Why store wealth when it could be circulated to benefit the nation?

Nigerians aspire for basic amenities and sustenance, questioning when the common man's needs will be addressed. Will the future bring about this change?
