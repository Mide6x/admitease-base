Race for Super Ships: Seamanship Goes Electronic

New and experienced mariners are now faced with the challenge of integrating high-tech electronic systems into various aspects of navigation. Advanced computers are utilized for bridge and engine room operations and control. The maritime industry has witnessed significant advancements through digital technology, encompassing satellite communications, software, navigation technology, and pirate detection and deterrence. Whether serving on a tanker, container ship, cruise ship, dry bulk carrier, military vessel, or in offshore sectors on the open sea, the key challenge lies in determining which technology to invest in and how to maximize its benefits - ultimately enhancing safety, operational efficiency, and quality of life onboard.

Maritime expert Captain Bernard Anazoh highlighted the increasing application of information technologies and electronic technologies in the shipping industry to enhance the safety of all types of vessels more than ever before. He noted that the engineering advancements in designing new ships have significantly reduced travel times. For example, older fleets that used to complete a one-way inter-island voyage in 24 hours have been replaced by modern second-hand vessels capable of making the same journey from port A to port B in 12 to 15 hours. Anazoh emphasized the shift from traditional tools like the Chronometer and Sextant to modern radar alarms, satellite navigation systems, and satellite communications systems among seafarers.

As a result, Anazoh pointed out that crew members on new ships must be proficient in utilizing modern navigation and safety equipment, such as the Global Maritime Distress Signal System (GMDSS), which plays a crucial role in guiding ships and maritime authorities during search and rescue operations in maritime emergencies. Dr. Hugh Nwaneri, Managing Director of Elkins Marine Training International, emphasized that modern seamanship is now IT-oriented, with computers and electronics being integrated into ship operations.

Nwaneri stressed the importance of seafarers mastering both traditional and modern seamanship, safety management, and computer operation skills. He highlighted the incorporation of advanced technologies on vessels, such as intelligent diesel engines, automatic navigation systems, automatic engine rooms, and automatic cargo-handling systems, necessitating a high-quality crew with specialized knowledge and skills.

In the transition from paper to electronic charts among seafarers, there is a significant effort to replace aging fleets with modern vessels, leading to substantial investments in navigational electronics. Local shipping companies face challenges meeting the demands of electronic navigation due to financial constraints, with shipowners often opting for second-hand vessels over new constructions due to budget constraints.

Nwaneri emphasized that modern ships are characterized by seaworthiness, fuel efficiency, environmental friendliness, and competent seafarers. The introduction of enhanced navigational electronics has revolutionized the shipping industry, ensuring compliance with the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, which focuses on enhancing manpower, technical proficiency, and environmental management for safe vessel operations.

The Rector of the Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron, stressed the need for improved training of seafarers to elevate them to higher positions on various types of ships. He underscored the importance of institutions offering training courses that acknowledge new technologies and regulations related to ship handling, safety, and pollution prevention, aligning with evolving global standards in maritime transport and technology.

In conclusion, the internationalization of seafarers' education and training underscores the necessity of adhering to global standards to meet the requirements set by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping.
